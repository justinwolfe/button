than the average person and how it intertwines in my mind with a parable i recently heard in another film, related by the legendary drummer ginger baker about jack bruce&#39;s bass playing and his sense of time. i&#39;m thankful for his argument, whether it&#39;s true or not, that jack bruce is the kind of person who wakes up early and goes out to see the sunrise, sees the sun come halfway above the horizon, and then turns around and goes home satisfied to tell everyone that he&#39;s seen a sunrise. i&#39;m thankful for the ecstatic grainy archival footage of ginger playing drum solos in his heyday, his eyes closed to take in some kind of sunrise. <br><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the occasional chirp of a bird outside the house. i&#39;m thankful because these chirps remind me pleasantly of how annoyed i got at the constant noise floor of the cicadas in the summer and early autumn. i&#39;m thankful for the peace of the winter, even if that&#39;s a reflection of death and disappearance. i&#39;m thankful to look out the window and see a skin of frost on the grass in the yard. i&#39;m thankful that i finally went down into the basement to change our furnace filters, a task i have been putting off since the beginning of vacation. i&#39;m thankful that there were no wild animals down in the basement and that though i had to push through dense nets of cobwebs, i didn&#39;t get bit by any spiders. i&#39;m thankful changing the furnace filters was a simple process and i regret putting it off for so long and letting the task take up space in my brain. </div></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the knausgaard <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-terrible-beauty-of-brain-surgery.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmagazine&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=magazine&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">article</a> about brain surgery. i&#39;m thankful for the structure and the returns and variations he plays, for his admission of his false nostalgia for life in the communist era (something i have a tendency towards also), for his cartographic descriptions of seeing the surface of the brain, and for his somewhat catty impressions of a famous surgeon&#39;s personality. i&#39;m thankful that the feeling lodged in my body after reading the piece reminds me more than anything of how i feel after reading a john mcphee profile, even though their working methods and subject positions and everything are so opposed. i&#39;m thankful for this passage:&quot;<i>i had looked into a room, unlike any other, and when i lifted my gaze, that room was inside hasanaj’s brain, who lay staring straight ahead under the drape in the larger room, filled with doctors and nurses and machines and equipment, and beyond that room there was an even larger room, warm and dusty and made of asphalt and concrete, beneath a chain of green mountains and a blue sky. all those rooms were gathered in my own brain, which looked exactly like hasanaj’s, a wet, gleaming, walnutlike lump, composed of 100 billion brain cells so tiny and so myriad they could only be compared to the stars of a galaxy. and yet what they formed was flesh, and the processes they harbored were simple and primitive, regulated by various chemical substances and powered by electricity. how could it contain these images of the world? how could thoughts arise within this hunk of flesh</i>?&quot; </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2015/12/30/10690560/time-speed-accelerate-age-new-year\">this vox explainer</a> about why the passage of time seems to accelerate as we get older. i&#39;m thankful for the various theories that are advanced in the article, including the idea that time seems to move faster for adults than for children because adults are busier than children. i&#39;m thankful for this illustrative quotation from william james: &quot;<i>each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic routine which we hardly notice at all, the days and weeks smooth themselves out in recollection, and the years grow hollow and collapse</i>.&quot;

year</a> about sobriety, to have rediscovered how much i love weed. i&#39;m thankful to not write about this very much to protect my present and future employability (this letter is email only and won&#39;t live on the web in my archives). i&#39;m thankful that part of me feels sad to break the impression set in that letter from a year ago, since i like the person depicted there and the way he found a place in the world, but i&#39;m thankful also for the opportunity to be real with you. i&#39;m thankful that i am a complex person and that i change over time and i&#39;m not ashamed of that.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful to have rediscovered how much i love weed when d and i were in chicago last december and after dinner one cold and rainy night we went to a grotty sex shop i found on yelp to buy a cheap vibrator (we forgot to pack one). i&#39;m thankful that while we were checking out, which (i had never bought a vibrator from a sex shop) involved this strange and elaborate process of the clerk putting on rubber gloves, taking the vibe out of the box and putting batteries in it, showing us that it worked, and then reversing the process to repackage it, i saw a display of cheap glass pipes in a display case and bought one on a whim.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful that night that we tried the pipe instead of our expensive USB-powered vaporizer and i got high in a way that i hadn&#39;t in a long time, without the jitters and unpleasantness that had accompanied my occasional vape highs of the previous year, which i had blamed on the prozac. i&#39;m thankful to have rediscovered the power of combustion and i&#39;m thankful that after a while with the pipe, we upgraded to a bong, which was even better. i&#39;m thankful for the experience of pulling the slide and the magic of physics pushing all of the smoke in the chamber at high speed into my lungs.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful to miss some of the purity of sobriety, but i&#39;m thankful for weed, which is kind of like a vibrator for the soul.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful i don&#39;t get high as frequently as i did in the past, that it doesn&#39;t have to be a daily ritual like it used to be, but i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s there when i need it. i&#39;m thankful to get high before all my band practices, which loosens my inhibitions and enhances my giggliness and my ability to feel a groove. i&#39;m thankful after a particularly stressful day at work to have a way to erase my exhaustion. i&#39;m thankful that when we went to knoxville in february, i had a bottle of weed tincture and was basically constantly very high, which is a lovely way to experience a vacation.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful weed has made it easier for me to (almost, 99.9% of the time) quit drinking, which has really been good for my stomach. i&#39;m thankful to know that this is such a tired and obvious point of view (i&#39;m thankful that in the united states we are always tired and obvious, which lends itself to this), but to feel that it really is horrible that weed is illegal but alcohol isn&#39;t. i&#39;m thankful to know that weed isn&#39;t for everyone, but i&#39;m thankful that it doesn&#39;t exacerbate any of my mental or physical illnesses and am thankful that for me it isn&#39;t a gateway drug that leads to addiction to more dangerous drugs.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful for weed, which unlike alcohol never hurts my stomach (unless i eat too much sugar, which is the one negative side effect) and unlike alcohol doesn&#39;t give me hangovers and unlike alcohol sometimes makes me feel a kind of spiritual grace. i&#39;m thankful for all the ideas that i have when i&#39;m stoned and i&#39;m thankful that though a lot of them are stupid, a lot of the ideas i have when i&#39;m sober are stupid too and there is a simple pleasure in just having a lot of ideas no matter their quality or whether they can be packaged into a product to be bought and sold. i&#39;m thankful that my brain on

tonight after work d and i will get high and eat strawberry shortcake and watch some TV and listen to some music on speakers and talk and touch each other (i&#39;m thankful for the way weed heightens

and she laughed for a second. i&#39;m thankful that when i left the room, she gave miso a credit card so she could take a photo of her with the credit card in her mouth, but then forgot about it, such that when i got home later that day, i found the card shredded by tiny teeth into scraps all over our living room floor.</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">i&#39;m thankful, since the day before we went to the ER she quit her job, which she was so good at but which was in an environment that was so hard, and we don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll be able to get a job like that in the future, if and when she&#39;s able to work at all, that i have a comfortable income for the place we live and that i have been diligent about saving money over the past few years, because of my own fear of poverty, which i have carried around since i was very young. i&#39;m thankful that my job is at a good place and that i am valued there and that they have been patient with the time that i&#39;ve needed. i&#39;m thankful that i have good insurance and that she has decent insurance now and will soon enough be on my good insurance. i&#39;m thankful to hope that i have the strength to help ground all of the hopes and dreams that she built up like towers in her mania without destroying the hope and the excitement that were tied up in them.</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">i&#39;m thankful that they have given her medications to stabilize her mood, which seem to be working a bit, a&nbsp;medication that makes it possible for her to sleep, which she wasn&#39;t really doing for weeks. i&#39;m thankful that this was, to me, such a clear early sign of something being wrong, since in our relationship, i have always been the insomniac and she has always been the person who falls asleep immediately and stays that way as long as (longer than) she wants. i&#39;m thankful for all the moments on a saturday afternoon where i caught her falling asleep on the couch, that i called her, with so much affection, my &quot;sleepy girl.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that the fact that at the heights of her angry mania she accused me of munchausen by proxy, that i wanted her docile and managed it can&#39;t erase all of those happy memories i have, of the times when i know that we loved each other and were happy.</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">i&#39;m thankful to understand, in the current absence of it, how much safety our love has given me, how much confidence and joy. i&#39;m thankful that i have these notes, which provide so many examples of the happy times that we&#39;ve shared in the nine years we&#39;ve been together. i&#39;m thankful to be able to go back to them at any time to feel that love, and that hopefully someday she will be able to too.&nbsp;<br/>\n<br/>\ni&#39;m thankful that though right now, i still only see occasional fragments of the person that i love, i do see those fragments at least, that the person i fell in love is&nbsp;not completely gone. i&#39;m thankful that when, on the phone, she was asking me to bring her panties but not wanting to say the word &quot;panties&quot;, she said, like a jeopardy clue, &quot;what you wanted to call our cat if we had a cat&quot; and i laughed because she was remembering a joke i had told her years ago. i&#39;m thankful that the she pressed the petals of the pink carnations i brought her on the first day (flowers which they trimmed and stored in a plastic urine container, the only safe vase available) into the pages of her notebook and yesterday showed me that, which she couldn&#39;t verbalize through the fog but which i took as her trying to say that she appreciated them, and me.</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">i&#39;m thankful that the first night i came home from the hospital and i wasn&#39;t yet ready to pass out, i watched things that reminded me of our love, that we shared in it and that were happy and good. i&#39;m thankful for the &quot;PDA&quot; episode of <i>the office</i>, which is about michael and holly&#39;s physically exuberant love, and for the episode of pen15 about never, and for hyori&#39;s bed and breakfast. i&#39;m thankful to have miso here, since even if the chores associated with her add up when i am the only one doing them, her presence is comforting. i&#39;m thankful that in the hospital, d has a little stuffed dog her best friend gave her and she says when she pets it, it feels like she&#39;s petting miso.</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">i&#39;m thankful to know that it is still very early in this journey, since even though that cleavage is still so fresh, it means that there is so much. i&#39;m thankful that there&#39;s nothing physically wrong with her, that she didn&#39;t hurt herself or anyone else. i&#39;m thankful for the book <i>loving someone with bipolar disorder: helping and understanding your partner</i>. i&#39;m thankful that my mom was able to convince d to go to the hospital, and i&#39;m thankful that i know it&#39;s been a silver lining for my parents that they&#39;ve been able to help me in a way that i&#39;ve never really needed their help. i&#39;m thankful that i have good friends who care about me. i&#39;m thankful i have these notes, and you. i&#39;m thankful to live life the way i have written these notes, the only way i know how, taking it day by day by day. i&#39;m thankful to hope there are good days yet to come, and to try to find the pieces of&nbsp;goodness i can in the days that aren&#39;t.</div>\n\n<div dir=\"auto\">&nbsp;</div>",

and was carrying around, which i showed to deborah and was like \"isn't that funny\" and she laughed for a second. i'm thankful that when i left the room, she gave miso a credit card so she could take a photo of her with the credit card in her mouth, but then forgot about it, such that when i got home later that day, i found the card shredded by tiny teeth into scraps all over our living room floor.\n\ni'm thankful, since the day before we went to the ER she quit her job, which she was so good at but which was in an environment that was so hard, and we don't know if she'll be able to get a job like that in the future, if and when she's able to work at all, that i have a comfortable income for the place we live and that i have been diligent about saving money over the past few years, because of my own fear of poverty, which i have carried around since i was very young. i'm thankful that my job is at a good place and that i am valued there and that they have been patient with the time that i've needed. i'm thankful that i have good insurance and that she has decent insurance now and will soon enough be on my good insurance. i'm thankful to hope that i have the strength to help ground all of the hopes and dreams that she built up like towers in her mania without destroying the hope and the excitement that were tied up in them.\n\ni'm thankful that they have given her medications to stabilize her mood, which seem to be working a bit, a medication that makes it possible for her to sleep, which she wasn't really doing for weeks. i'm thankful that this was, to me, such a clear early sign of something being wrong, since in our relationship, i have always been the insomniac and she has always been the person who falls asleep immediately and stays that way as long as (longer than) she wants. i'm thankful for all the moments on a saturday afternoon where i caught her falling asleep on the couch, that i called her, with so much affection, my \"sleepy girl.\" i'm thankful that the fact that at the heights of her angry mania she accused me of munchausen by proxy, that i wanted her docile and managed it can't erase all of those happy memories i have, of the times when i know that we loved each other and were happy.\n\ni'm thankful to understand, in the current absence of it, how much safety our love has given me, how much confidence and joy. i'm thankful that i have these notes, which provide so many examples of the happy times that we've shared in the nine years we've been together. i'm thankful to be able to go back to them at any time to feel that love, and that hopefully someday she will be able to too.   \n  \ni'm thankful that though right now, i still only see occasional fragments of the person that i love, i do see those fragments at least, that the person i fell in love is not completely gone. i'm thankful that when, on the phone, she was asking me to bring her panties but not wanting to say the word \"panties\", she said, like a jeopardy clue, \"what you wanted to call our cat if we had a cat\" and i laughed because she was remembering a joke i had told her years ago. i'm thankful that the she pressed the petals of the pink carnations i brought her on the first day (flowers which they trimmed and stored in a plastic urine container, the only safe vase available) into the pages of her notebook and yesterday showed me that, which she couldn't verbalize through the fog but which i took as her trying to say that she appreciated them, and me.\n\ni'm thankful that the first night i came home from the hospital and i wasn't yet ready to pass out, i watched things that reminded me of our love, that we shared in it and that were happy and good. i'm thankful for the \"PDA\" episode of _the office_, which is about michael and holly's physically exuberant love, and for the episode of pen15 about never, and for hyori's bed and breakfast. i'm thankful to have miso here, since even if the chores associated with her add up when i am the only one doing them, her presence is comforting. i'm thankful that in the hospital, d has a little stuffed dog her best friend gave her and she says when she pets it, it feels like she's petting miso.\n\ni'm thankful to know that it is still very early in this journey, since even though that cleavage is still so fresh, it means that there is so much. i'm thankful that there's nothing physically wrong with her, that she didn't hurt herself or anyone else. i'm thankful for the book _loving someone with bipolar disorder: helping and understanding your partner_. i'm thankful that my mom was able to convince d to go to the hospital, and i'm thankful that i know it's been a silver lining for my parents that they've been able to help me in a way that i've never really needed their help. i'm thankful that i have good friends who care about me. i'm thankful i have these notes, and you. i'm thankful to live life the way i have written these notes, the only way i know how, taking it day by day by day. i'm thankful to hope there are good days yet to come, and to try to find the pieces of goodness i can in the days that aren't."

remind you of yourself, or another person, or something you believe, or the just outside world. i&#39;m thankful, when she talks about crystals or tarot or astrology, to try to be kind and

computer after not having (consciously) used a cloud-based option for a long time because i loved the manual intentional ritual of doing an airdrop when i had an iphone, the framing of &quot;transmission&quot; where i hit a button on the phone and the UI lags and then it pops up and makes a sound on my computer screen, and i&#39;m thankful, as someone who doesn&#39;t use facebook and get its &quot;[n] years ago&quot; commemorations, google photos (which apparently has been slurping up my photos for years without me intentionally sending them, which is not great but honestly i don&#39;t care) provides those and so i&#39;m thankful that yesterday, i opened google photos to find a screenshot i had taken the other day and was presented with images from five, three, and one year ago, and i&#39;m thankful that the five year ago one was of d and i in the park near our apartment in bloomington on a very snowy winter day, her smiling out under the fur hood of her heavy coat, and i&#39;m thankful that the three years ago was the trip we had taken to knoxville to visit her friend a and ridden in go karts and played putt putt and i&#39;m thankful that the image from one year ago was, i could tell almost instantly of the wings at pok pok, which we ate on our first trip to portland during what was the absolute worst time of my life (i remember thinking this sentence over and over during the weekend, &quot;this is the worst day of my life&quot; and then it would just get worse) where d was suddenly a different person and we were in different realities and there seemed to be no way at all for us to climb back into the bond which had felt so permanent and comforting for so long (so many photos over so many years) and i have never been a person who thinks about the distant future much, which had always been a difference between d and i, but suddenly i had lost all faith that the future i thought was automatic would happen at all and i just saw a big dark nothing in front of us and anyway i&#39;m thankful that though that was a very bad time, the absolute worst time in my life, we&#39;re both doing great now and doing great together.<div><br><div

    "contentMd": "i'm thankful that after switching to the big dumb android phone i hate, i started using google photos to share pictures easily between my phone and ipad and computer after not having (consciously) used a cloud-based option for a long time because i loved the manual intentional ritual of doing an airdrop when i had an iphone, the framing of \"transmission\" where i hit a button on the phone and the UI lags and then it pops up and makes a sound on my computer screen, and i'm thankful, as someone who doesn't use facebook and get its \"\\[n\\] years ago\" commemorations, google photos (which apparently has been slurping up my photos for years without me intentionally sending them, which is not great but honestly i don't care) provides those and so i'm thankful that yesterday, i opened google photos to find a screenshot i had taken the other day and was presented with images from five, three, and one year ago, and i'm thankful that the five year ago one was of d and i in the park near our apartment in bloomington on a very snowy winter day, her smiling out under the fur hood of her heavy coat, and i'm thankful that the three years ago was the trip we had taken to knoxville to visit her friend a and ridden in go karts and played putt putt and i'm thankful that the image from one year ago was, i could tell almost instantly of the wings at pok pok, which we ate on our first trip to portland during what was the absolute worst time of my life (i remember thinking this sentence over and over during the weekend, \"this is the worst day of my life\" and then it would just get worse) where d was suddenly a different person and we were in different realities and there seemed to be no way at all for us to climb back into the bond which had felt so permanent and comforting for so long (so many photos over so many years) and i have never been a person who thinks about the distant future much, which had always been a difference between d and i, but suddenly i had lost all faith that the future i thought was automatic would happen at all and i just saw a big dark nothing in front of us and anyway i'm thankful that though that was a very bad time, the absolute worst time in my life, we're both doing great now and doing great together.\n\n\\---------- Forwarded message ---------  \nFrom: **justin wolfe**
