    "content": "i'm thankful that d likes the air plants that i got her for christmas. i'm thankful that air plants can remove nutrients and moisture from dust, which feels poetic. i'm thankful that the oyster mushrooms she is growing in a cardboard box in the kitchen are growing so fast. i'm thankful to check in with them over the course of the day and see the changes in their size and shape. i'm thankful for how this reminds me of the ferns that i am charged with watering at the office. i'm thankful for how when i forget to water the ferns for too long, i can tell because of how droopy their leaves get. i'm thankful for the fern across from my desk, on top of the office mini-fridge, which gets particularly droopy and so is my coal mine canary, but which, if i water it well in a morning when i notice its droopiness, will spring back up by the end of the day, refreshed. i'm thankful to hope that it and the other ferns have not died over christmas vacation, which is probably the longest they have gone without me watering them since i started this job. i'm thankful for the line in _nymphomaniac_ about how trees may not be as obviously beautiful in the winter, naked without their leaves, but that winter is the best time to examine them because it is then that you can see the soul of the trees. i'm thankful for the idea, advanced by christian slater's character, that everyone has one particular tree which matches their soul. i'm thankful for the shot, near the end of volume 2, where charlotte gainsbourg's character finds her soul tree twisting out of a rocky outcropping at the cliff edge of an alpine forest.\n\ni'm thankful for the concept in that film of what it means to \"demand more from a sunset\" than the average person and how it intertwines in my mind with a parable i recently heard in another film, related by the legendary drummer ginger baker about jack bruce's bass playing and his sense of time. i'm thankful for his argument, whether it's true or not, that jack bruce is the kind of person who wakes up early and goes out to see the sunrise, sees the sun come halfway above the horizon, and then turns around and goes home satisfied to tell everyone that he's seen a sunrise. i'm thankful for the ecstatic grainy archival footage of ginger playing drum solos in his heyday, his eyes closed to take in some kind of sunrise.\n\ni'm thankful for the occasional chirp of a bird outside the house. i'm thankful because these chirps remind me pleasantly of how annoyed i got at the constant noise floor of the cicadas in the summer and early autumn. i'm thankful for the peace of the winter, even if that's a reflection of death and disappearance. i'm thankful to look out the window and see a skin of frost on the grass in the yard. i'm thankful that i finally went down into the basement to change our furnace filters, a task i have been putting off since the beginning of vacation. i'm thankful that there were no wild animals down in the basement and that though i had to push through dense nets of cobwebs, i didn't get bit by any spiders. i'm thankful changing the furnace filters was a simple process and i regret putting it off for so long and letting the task take up space in my brain.\n\ni'm thankful for the knausgaard [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-terrible-beauty-of-brain-surgery.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmagazine&action=click&contentCollection=magazine&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0) about brain surgery. i'm thankful for the structure and the returns and variations he plays, for his admission of his false nostalgia for life in the communist era (something i have a tendency towards also), for his cartographic descriptions of seeing the surface of the brain, and for his somewhat catty impressions of a famous surgeon's personality. i'm thankful that the feeling lodged in my body after reading the piece reminds me more than anything of how i feel after reading a john mcphee profile, even though their working methods and subject positions and everything are so opposed. i'm thankful for this passage:\"_i had looked into a room, unlike any other, and when i lifted my gaze, that room was inside hasanaj’s brain, who lay staring straight ahead under the drape in the larger room, filled with doctors and nurses and machines and equipment, and beyond that room there was an even larger room, warm and dusty and made of asphalt and concrete, beneath a chain of green mountains and a blue sky. all those rooms were gathered in my own brain, which looked exactly like hasanaj’s, a wet, gleaming, walnutlike lump, composed of 100 billion brain cells so tiny and so myriad they could only be compared to the stars of a galaxy. and yet what they formed was flesh, and the processes they harbored were simple and primitive, regulated by various chemical substances and powered by electricity. how could it contain these images of the world? how could thoughts arise within this hunk of flesh_?\"\n\ni'm thankful for [this vox explainer](http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2015/12/30/10690560/time-speed-accelerate-age-new-year) about why the passage of time seems to accelerate as we get older. i'm thankful for the various theories that are advanced in the article, including the idea that time seems to move faster for adults than for children because adults are busier than children. i'm thankful for this illustrative quotation from william james: \"_each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic routine which we hardly notice at all, the days and weeks smooth themselves out in recollection, and the years grow hollow and collapse_.\" i'm thankful for the hopeful note the end of the explainer strikes, that perhaps breaking routines and learning new things is one way to lay sandbags against the erosion of time. i'm thankful to think that perhaps another weapon against acceleration is to find ways to focus more deeply on the present as you experience it, to use your attention as a brake to slow motion. i'm thankful for the gentle click of the keys as i type this sentence, for the rumble of the furnace down in the basement pumping warm air up through the vents into the living room, for the occasional chirp of a bird outside the house.",

    "content": "i'm thankful to consider the question of whether gratitude means an acceptance of the status quo, even if that status quo is unjust and evil. i'm thankful to recognize that my personal investment in the concept of gratitude, as well as the privilege and security inherent in my subject position, might blind me from fully or appropriately considering the question, but thankful that considering the question feels like an important enough thing for me to continue along this line of inquiry here in these notes, however limited my personal perspective on it might be and however useless these words end up being. i'm thankful if you would like to listen to me think but thankful also if you close this email now.\n\ni'm thankful to know and to recognize that we live in a society which is profoundly unjust for the people of color who live in it with me, even though knowing and recognizing that injustice doesn't seem to make any difference. i'm thankful to know that the only real way to even begin to try to correct that injustice comes through systemic legislative and judicial reform. i'm thankful that i know the necessity of this even though in the current political climate of my society, it seems impossible to conceive of achieving even a small fraction of the type of reforms that would even begin to try to answer to the enormity of the injustice, the genocide and theft and slavery and appropriation that are the central and foundational acts of the society that we live in and that continue to the present day.\n\ni'm thank to make clear that while i value gratitude and try to demonstrate that value to you daily as a way to try to help make our lives and, in a small way, the world better, i don't think we should ever feel gratitude for this kind of injustice, especially injustice as profound as the injustice of the society we live in. i'm thankful that sometimes in these notes i send you i might use a sentence that begins \"i'm thankful\" and then describes a quotidian unpleasant thing which i then try to view through the lens of gratitude as an exercise, but i'm thankful to know that there are limits to this rhetorical device. i'm thankful to know that there isn't (and shouldn't be) any way to be grateful for the murder or discrimination or abuse or theft or harm against people of color that is sanctioned by the state and accepted as the status quo by the society we live in.\n\ni'm thankful for [this post](http://lazenby.tumblr.com/post/125706997537/how-do-you-explain-the-new-kind-of-civil-rights) i was reading which talks about the foundational concept of gandhi's theory and its revelatory influence on martin luther king jr. when he heard it described one day while he was a student in seminary.\n\n\"_On April 9th, 1950 Martin Luther King heard a black preacher named Mordecai Johnson (then the president of Howard University) speak in Philadelphia. Johnson had spent some time in India and spoke at length about the philosophical underpinnings of Gandhi’s method._ \n\n_To Gandhi, nonviolence was a matchless weapon. This is because it is founded on a concept called **satyagraha**. This word means something like ‘truth-force’ or ‘the persuasive power of love’ in Sanskrit. Nonviolent resistance could never be defeated because it was founded on love for one’s enemies. This love is the source of a protester’s refusal to physically attack his or her adversary. In Gandhi’s hands, and with the help of the international press, it had just been used to win the independence of 390 million people._ \n\n_King later said that this talk was so “electrifying that I left the meeting and went out and purchased half a dozen books on Gandhi’s life and works.” King was then still a student at Crozer Theological Seminary, just south of Philadelphia. That Sunday in 1950 was the beginning of nonviolent resistance in the American Civil Rights movement._\n\n_In reading about Gandhi’s philosophy and the strategy for Indian independence that it generated, Martin Luther King came to several realizations:_\n\n_Nonviolent resistance refuses to participate in evil, but not in the same way that pacifism refuses. If pacifism simply refuses to participate in evil, nonviolent resistance is a passionate and relentless intervention in the lives of those who do participate in evil. In this way, King saw that the basic tension in any racial struggle was not between the races but instead within in the hearts of those who oppress. A tension between the basic desire of all human beings to be good and the racist conditioning by which life in America blunts this desire and bends their actions, instead, towards evil. King, like Gandhi before him, realized that nonviolent resistance was a way of untwisting the hearts of those who did this evil. Both saw nonviolent resistance as a kind of therapy that the oppressed performed on the oppressor_\"\n\ni'm thankful to hear in the description of nonviolent resistance as \"_a kind of therapy that the oppressed performed on the oppressor_\" an echo of the exhaustion that i hear described frequently by people of color, this feeling that not only do they have to suffer every day from profound injustice and discrimination and violence and pervasive fear and alienation in the society that we live in, but then they also have to make white people like me feel better about it too. i'm thankful that i can't even imagine how hard and frustrating that must be. i'm thankful to recognize that for people to whom profound social and emotional and physical violence is done daily, as part of the basic, accepted routines of life, gratitude for the world must be exceedingly hard to come by. i'm thankful to not expect people living impossibly hard lives to make themselves martyrs or saints, especially since in the society i live in there are enough white policemen murdering people of color and converting them into those holy images already.\n\ni'm thankful that i admire this concept of satyagraha that drove gandhi and king but i find that however attuned i try to force myself every day to be to gratitude and to kindness in my life, i can't imagine feeling it, much less imagine myself as a person of color feeling it, can't imagine the size of the reservoir of love energy that would be required to balance out the mass of the forces of oppression weighing down the bodies of people of color in the society we live in. i'm thankful that, though i am not religious and though i think great evil is and has been and will continue be done in the name of religion, that throughout history and up to the present day, faith and belief have provided oppressed people who are subject to endless violence and fear with some measure of comfort and strength.\n\ni'm thankful that this is why i write the things i do these days, in the hope that it will provide people with some measure of comfort and strength. i'm thankful, in that spirit, to try to conceive of gratitude as a kind of tactic, in the sense of the situationists, who believed, amid the violence of 68, in the power of \"_creating '__situations' where humans would interact together as people, not mediated by commodities. They saw in moments of true community the possibility of a future, joyful and un-alienated society. '__People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have corpses in their mouths.'\"_ i'm thankful to suggest attention to and gratitude for small things you value in the world as a tactic in this sense, not because the society we live in is just and fair and perfect, but because so much in the world is horrible and wrong and you have to save yourself from it, every day, by reminding yourself why you want to live, what you are living for.\n\n[i'm thankful for the thudding kick drum and for its dance with the clap and the chimes and the streamers of out of time (and yet in time) guitar flickering at the edges of the image. i'm thankful for the way that the cymbal chokes a breath at the end of bars. i'm thankful for the sense of space in the samples, a place to live inside. i'm thankful for the space echo on her vocals, so that her voice makes a woozy choir of itself behind her, like the train on a ball gown. i'm thankful for when she sings \"_w__e been livin' through your internet_\" and suddenly her voice disappears the music falls out, the space collapsing, and there's the sound of a gong chiming in front of you and then she's back in the world, singing \"_you don't have to believe everything you think / w__e've been programmed wake up, we miss you_.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XykIswFgLpU)",

    "content": "i'm thankful, after writing [one of my favorite letters on this day last year](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-4-20) about sobriety, to have rediscovered how much i love weed. i'm thankful to not write about this very much to protect my present and future employability (this letter is email only and won't live on the web in my archives). i'm thankful that part of me feels sad to break the impression set in that letter from a year ago, since i like the person depicted there and the way he found a place in the world, but i'm thankful also for the opportunity to be real with you. i'm thankful that i am a complex person and that i change over time and i'm not ashamed of that.\n\ni'm thankful to have rediscovered how much i love weed when d and i were in chicago last december and after dinner one cold and rainy night we went to a grotty sex shop i found on yelp to buy a cheap vibrator (we forgot to pack one). i'm thankful that while we were checking out, which (i had never bought a vibrator from a sex shop) involved this strange and elaborate process of the clerk putting on rubber gloves, taking the vibe out of the box and putting batteries in it, showing us that it worked, and then reversing the process to repackage it, i saw a display of cheap glass pipes in a display case and bought one on a whim. \n\ni'm thankful that night that we tried the pipe instead of our expensive USB-powered vaporizer and i got high in a way that i hadn't in a long time, without the jitters and unpleasantness that had accompanied my occasional vape highs of the previous year, which i had blamed on the prozac. i'm thankful to have rediscovered the power of combustion and i'm thankful that after a while with the pipe, we upgraded to a bong, which was even better. i'm thankful for the experience of pulling the slide and the magic of physics pushing all of the smoke in the chamber at high speed into my lungs.\n\ni'm thankful to miss some of the purity of sobriety, but i'm thankful for weed, which is kind of like a vibrator for the soul. \n\ni'm thankful i don't get high as frequently as i did in the past, that it doesn't have to be a daily ritual like it used to be, but i'm thankful that it's there when i need it. i'm thankful to get high before all my band practices, which loosens my inhibitions and enhances my giggliness and my ability to feel a groove. i'm thankful after a particularly stressful day at work to have a way to erase my exhaustion. i'm thankful that when we went to knoxville in february, i had a bottle of weed tincture and was basically constantly very high, which is a lovely way to experience a vacation. \n\ni'm thankful weed has made it easier for me to (almost, 99.9% of the time) quit drinking, which has really been good for my stomach. i'm thankful to know that this is such a tired and obvious point of view (i'm thankful that in the united states we are always tired and obvious, which lends itself to this), but to feel that it really is horrible that weed is illegal but alcohol isn't. i'm thankful to know that weed isn't for everyone, but i'm thankful that it doesn't exacerbate any of my mental or physical illnesses and am thankful that for me it isn't a gateway drug that leads to addiction to more dangerous drugs. \n\ni'm thankful for weed, which unlike alcohol never hurts my stomach (unless i eat too much sugar, which is the one negative side effect) and unlike alcohol doesn't give me hangovers and unlike alcohol sometimes makes me feel a kind of spiritual grace. i'm thankful for all the ideas that i have when i'm stoned and i'm thankful that though a lot of them are stupid, a lot of the ideas i have when i'm sober are stupid too and there is a simple pleasure in just having a lot of ideas no matter their quality or whether they can be packaged into a product to be bought and sold. i'm thankful that my brain on drugs isn't a frying pan with an egg in it but a field where a mysterious variety of flowers sprout in a sped-up timelapse springtime.\n\ni'm thankful that tonight after work d and i will get high and eat strawberry shortcake and watch some TV and listen to some music on speakers and talk and touch each other (i'm thankful for the way weed heightens sensations like touch and brings down the barriers we sometimes wear through our everyday lives) and have ideas and write and draw and play guitar and laugh and smile and then probably fall asleep earlier than usual but also happier than usual. i'm thankful to know that we could and do experience all of those things with weed, but i'm also thankful for weed.",
