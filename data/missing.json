by phillip&nbsp;<span class=\"lG\">larkin</span>. &nbsp;i also remember d and i trying to have sex, because i felt better and because i wanted to show her how much i appreciated her and loved her, and i couldn&#39;t feel my penis. &nbsp;that was enough to stop me from taking it and to tell my doctor that i felt like i was handling things with meditation and exercise and good sleep hygiene. &nbsp;and the fear of that absence of feeling is the primary thing that&#39;s kept me from considering this in the past and instead indulging in a panoply of expensive and i think mostly useless over the counter herbal whatevers.&nbsp;</i></div>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\"><i>i hope the numbness goes away but, as i said, i can&#39;t keep going forward on the path i was on. &nbsp;it would destroy me much sooner than would be natural otherwise. &nbsp;(that sounds so melodramatic, but it is true). &nbsp;so let&#39;s try this! &nbsp;i feel like i started feeling something after a few hours - i had to make a catering order for the retreat tomorrow, which stressed me out but the stress felt like the volume was turned down just a few db and then faded much faster than it normally would. &nbsp;then i guess the next thing i noticed was a sense of strangeness as i gchatted with d. &nbsp;my thoughts felt much more clearly segmented/fragmented than the long rambly chains i normally employ. &nbsp;i also felt a certain self-consciousness that made me think of tao lin - a dissociation or a sense of strangeness at trying to use words to express myself. &nbsp;i inadvertently was rude to d but she forgave me, so that was all okay and as we talked more i felt more articulate and normal. &nbsp;on my lunch walk, i talked to my parents and i think felt and came across as normal, though i was maybe slightly less engaged than i normally would have been.</i></div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\"><i>then this afternoon, it&#39;s been perhaps more muted but again, i just generally feel a lot lighter, like my nervous system&#39;s tuning strings have been loosened. &nbsp;it is great. &nbsp;i also seem to be able to let things go faster and to not obsessively check over emails (which lead to me making a typo, but i didn&#39;t really care! that&#39;s great!!! i used to feel so destroyed by a typo, even when the person i was writing to could barely communicate with me). &nbsp;maybe a slight tension in my temples and occasional shakiness, but not really any other negative side effect feelings. &nbsp;i will check in again tomorrow but i feel much better than yesterday and that is a cause for celebration.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(85, 85, 85);

really is kind of true for some things. i&#39;m thankful that forcing myself to smile because i work in customer service has made me more naturally and comfortably smile all the time. i&#39;m thankful to use my smile and i&#39;m thankful to think of it almost as a weapon of kindness--i&#39;m thankful for the moments when i see someone who looks unhappy or stressed out in the hallway and i aim a smile at them and their face changes and i feel like a small good thing has happened.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful, while i&#39;m running, to watch people shoot free throws on the basketball courts in the center of the track. i&#39;m thankful sometimes, as their balls arc through the air, to wish for them to swish effortlessly into the net. i&#39;m thankful for the ambient music of the balls bouncing through the natural reverb of the gym as i sit on the sidelines and meditate. i&#39;m thankful that even though i&#39;m always slightly afraid of being hit by a stray ball, the only time it happened, the ball neatly rolled into my lap and i chest-passed it to the player without even leaving lotus. i&#39;m thankful for my sometimes fantasy of having a basketball hoop and shooting free throws by myself as a meditative activity when i&#39;m older. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m finally letting go of the baggage of being bulled in 9th grade gym class in tennessee by this asshole who called me &quot;virginia slims.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the moment when i was so fed up with failing to be able to dribble or pass or shoot or, worst of all, make layups, that i broke down crying in the coach&#39;s office and begged him to let me run stairs or do pushups or anything else instead of play basketball for one more day. i&#39;m thankful that he listened to me and let me, even though he didn&#39;t have to. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t have to take gym class after 9th grade and i&#39;m thankful for the way in college that i rediscovered (or, really, discovered for the first time) how wonderful exercise can be. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m healthy enough and i have enough free time to be able to exercise regularly.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the bathroom mirror at the gym, which always makes my biceps look bigger than they are for some reason (maybe the distance from it, or the angle?). i&#39;m thankful that even if i recently put on a little holiday weight, i feel comfortable with my body. i&#39;m thankful to imagine that next time i&#39;m in miami, i could go to the clothing-optional beach that my parents love (though not <i>with</i> my parents, i don&#39;t think) and i wouldn&#39;t really feel self-conscious at all. <br></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the moment yesterday, when i was trying to help one of the visiting lecturers open up a file cabinet in her office—the drawers wouldn&#39;t open, but there was no key hole, just a small metal knob where a keyhole might be. i&#39;m thankful that we both tried turning the small metal knob but it had no effect and we couldn&#39;t figure out why. i&#39;m thankful that when i asked people in the office if they&#39;d ever experienced anything else like this, they all said they hadn&#39;t. i&#39;m thankful that when i asked my manager, she said she&#39;d come check it out. i&#39;m thankful that when she turned the small metal knob, she had the same experience that the visiting lecturer and i had. i&#39;m thankful, then, for the moment when she reached up and, grabbing the handle of the drawer, pressed the small button on the side of the handle, which the visiting lecturer and i had not imagined or considered, and effortlessly pulled the top drawer open and then every other drawer after it. i&#39;m thankful for the laughter we all shared at that magically banal reveal.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to watch rows of students in basketball class make layups, one after another.<br></div><div><br></div></div>\n\n",

her saying the name of the student who was in the dream i had last night. i&#39;m thankful for my laughter at this coincidence and her laughter as i told her the story of the dream and for our commiseration about how difficult the student can be.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful i overheard another student in the hallway saying, about a faculty member, &#39;i&#39;m so sad that i won&#39;t have a class with [redacted] next year--she&#39;s the best.&quot;

for the moment in <i>food on franklin</i> when taylor berman mentions making a pumpkin pie and accidentally leaving out a cup of sugar and how that reminds me of when d made pumpkin pie and also forgot the sugar (i&#39;m thankful that the pie was still edible, with a little maple syrup and a lot of whipped cream, and i&#39;m thankful that she made another a few days later). i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t hurt myself while running and i&#39;m thankful that i had the target on the other side of town as my goal. i&#39;m thankful that though the target was ransacked, i was able to find a few small cheap packages of the white lights that d requested to make the house more festive. i&#39;m thankful that i bought a specially flavored coke and cherry package of tic tacs, even if i remembered after eating too many how bad they are for my teeth and how i shouldn&#39;t eat them. i&#39;m thankful that even carrying a big shopping bag on one arm, i still passed multiple joggers on my way home.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the nice text conversation i had with my dad about a holiday beer sampler that we both coincidentally bought on saturday. i&#39;m thankful that even though i prefer talking on the phone with them, i&#39;ve gotten better at exchanging texts and emails with my parents, which i used to find challenging. i&#39;m thankful for synchronous and asynchronous forms. i&#39;m thankful for the holiday beer sampler, from which my favorite was either the cappucino stout or the cinnamon horchata ale. i&#39;m thankful that i restrained myself and did not add a shot of whiskey on top of my dinner beer like i wanted to. i&#39;m thankful for the kale and mixed greens and sliced grape salad i made and i&#39;m thankful for the half of a sesame seed bagel i had on the side.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to listen to good music on good speakers in our living room. i&#39;m thankful, after years of living in a second floor apartment where we had to turn the sub off and constantly monitor treble levels, that we can listen to music with rich bass in high definition. i&#39;m thankful for <i>abbey road </i>and i&#39;m thankful that d liked the dilla albums (the new <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY74n5lMrJAhWRnoMKHTdvCaIQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpitchfork.com%2Fnews%2F61783-j-dillas-dillatronic-streams-featuring-41-rare-instrumentals%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzcRNi7bW9pLF3YxOWRtNs-cgMuQ&amp;sig2=KffQn6svVsPFrQgqqNTc3g&amp;bvm=bv.108538919,d.amc\">dillatronic</a> and the classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donuts_(album)\">donuts</a>) that i put on in the background while she worked and i played fallout 4. i&#39;m thankful for the lockpicking minigame in fallout 4, which is just difficult enough for me to find it weirdly satisfying. i&#39;m thankful for the subtle vibration the controller makes as i turn the pick in the keyhole. i&#39;m thankful for the great sidequest that takes place in a high school, where a principal has a group of troublemakers sell intelligence enhancing drugs to the student body in order to improve the test scores. i&#39;m thankful for the diary of the main troublemaker, who starts taking the drugs himself and whose increase in intelligence is reflected both in improved diction and grammar of his entries and in the plot he hatches to blackmail the principal.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the kardashians, always. i&#39;m thankful for the scene of khloe and kourtney ignoring kris to take selfies and how practiced and polished their selfie faces are. i&#39;m thankful for kim&#39;s love of beignets and churros and ice cream cones and cheesecake. i&#39;m thankful she went to paris mostly for churros, which seems absurd. i&#39;m thankful for how kim&#39;s fear, during her ultrasound, that her blood pressure will be too high reminds me of my fear during ultrasounds and blood pressure checks in the past. i&#39;m thankful for the time at the urgent care in miami when the doctor brought a student in to feel my heart murmur through her stethoscope. i&#39;m thankful for the last ultrasound i had, when the tech gave me a warm blanket to cover myself with and said it was fine if i put on my headphones to help calm myself down. i&#39;m thankful that my current cardiologist is nice and feels confident about my present and my future. </div><div><br></div>i&#39;m thankful for the caramel apple jolly rancher lollipop one of the doctoral students gave me. i&#39;m thankful when i get my yoga mat rolled perfectly neat and tight the first time. i&#39;m thankful for the experience, early this morning, of biking under the arm of a huge crane hanging so low over the path that i could almost touch it with my fingertips.</div>\n\n",

i&#39;m thankful that the professor dropped in by chance as she was walking down the hallway and, despite his bad knee, lunged in to grab the book so that he could give it to her before she left. i&#39;m thankful for his laughter as i related the story to him.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that though i made a bitchy comment at my coworker yesterday afternoon because i felt annoyed at her draining need for attention and praise (where I would usually just nod and make affirmative yet disengaged noises), she was in such a good mood that it bounced off seemingly (hopefully) without her noticing and i&#39;m thankful that in a slow motion split second i realized my break from decorum and regained my composure and papered over the rift in pleasantness with laughter and a compliment. i&#39;m thankful that, even if i sometimes get annoyed with aspects of her personality that don&#39;t feel compatible with aspects of my personality, she is smart and works hard and is a good person. i&#39;m thankful that she is going on a long vacation next week, both for her sake and for my own.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for my work friend t. i&#39;m thankful for the game we play of trying to surprise each other in some way when we say hello to each other in passing during the week. i&#39;m thankful that yesterday, grasping at straws for something to do. i put two large pink post-its on my glasses covering my eyes before i entered her office. i&#39;m thankful for her laughter and then, as i peeled off the post-its, my shock at the fact that she had shaved her head over the weekend. i&#39;m thankful for her invitation to rub her shaved head, which felt interesting, and for the anecdote another person told me in the office about how she sweetly went around and asked whether anyone else would mind if she shaved her head. i&#39;m glad they all said &quot;no, of course not,&quot; and i&#39;m glad she confessed to me that would have shaved it even if people had said yes.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>\n\n",

i&#39;m thankful for another faculty member, who is at a conference in australia right now and asked me to water his plants. i&#39;m thankful for his pale pink orchid, which is miraculously still in bloom. i&#39;m thankful for the treasure chest of hershey&#39;s nuggets that he always keep well stocked to motivate his fellow faculty. i&#39;m thankful for the funny (by the standards of office humor) sign i made and put on his door to inform his many visitors of his absence. i&#39;m thankful for the student with a pixie haircut and a large black cyborg brace on her arm, who told me that she broke a bone in her elbow while in her friend&#39;s kitchen making cinnamon rolls and, for some reason, began doing high kicks. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for how nice it feels to be able to lend a student office supplies or to print or copy something for them when they&#39;re stressed and trying to get things done at the last minute. i&#39;m thankful for the relief they exude when i tell them that yes, they can borrow my stapler. i&#39;m thankful for how much this tiny gesture might affect the emotional contours of their day. i&#39;m thankful for the long conversation i had with a doctoral student about lap steel guitar, alternate tunings, the fairport convention, and nick drake. i&#39;m thankful that i had a nice conversation with the coworker i made the bitchy comment to the other day, about her dating life and her plans for her vacation. i&#39;m thankful that we had this conversation while we decorated the office with a small but well lit christmas tree and various holiday tchotchkes. i&#39;m thankful for the hilarity of learning that what she thinks the game twenty questions is is not what most of the world thinks the game twenty questions is.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the minor but important distinction between being told or telling someone &quot;have a nice day&quot; and being told or telling someone &quot;have a good day.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that though occasionally on the phone or in formal settings, i&#39;ll slip into the robotic cliche of &quot;have a nice day,&quot; i almost always use the warmer and more meaningful &quot;have a good day.&quot; i&#39;m thankful to remember how OCD and anxious i was in high school, when i depended on my mom to tell me to have a good day every day when she dropped me off at school, because i thought that that was like an incantation and that if she forgot to say it, i was sure to have a bad day (not that the incantation always prevented me from having a bad day). i&#39;m thankful that while i still think of the phrase as a kind of protective spell, i am not so dependent on its effects to ensure my happiness. i&#39;m thankful for my customer service role, which affords me many opportunities every day to tell people, with genuine feeling, like making a wish for them, to have a good day. i&#39;m thankful for every opportunity to tell them, and you, and myself, to have a good day.</div></div>\n\n",

i&#39;m thankful for how we accidentally wandered along the route of a mini-marathon on our walk, and how the cool guy from the track was running it and said hi to me and d. i&#39;m thankful for the long conversation d and i had about the intricacies of <i>daredevil, </i>which she has been watching while on the treadmill, and about how christian theology and cosmology interacts or doesn&#39;t with superhero worlds. i&#39;m thankful for the brief failed facetime we had with my family, who were sitting in a diner and waiting on steak and eggs and chicken and waffles. i&#39;m thankful that despite the poor connection, i still made several funny jokes.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for a lazy browse around a bougie supermarket. i&#39;m thankful for mangos that were 4 for a dollar and limes that were 5 for a dollar, even if these probably speak to a horrible supply chain that is destroying the earth (i&#39;m thankful for the small possibility that this is not the case, because of the veneer of responsible consumption (whatever that is) that is a major pillar of the bougie supermarket&#39;s brand). i&#39;m thankful for the small bag of freeze dried mandarin oranges i bought, which were weird but not that good, and for the small bag of salted caramel yogurt pretzels, which were normal and very good. i&#39;m thankful that we got home from our walk just in time for lunch, and i&#39;m thankful that we still had caramelized onions and mushrooms left over to put in our scrambled eggs. i&#39;m thankful that the new dinner recipes i tried on friday and saturday, for a kind of faux bibimbap and a mu shu chicken, both turned out, despite my grumbling and complaining, really well and will, i think, become part of our regular repertoire. i&#39;m thankful that though i made some kind of mistake cooking the brown rice for the faux bibimbap and scorched the bottom of the pressure cooker, it actually gave the rice a nice <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurungji\">nurungji</a> feel and the pressure cooker mostly came clean. i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungnyung\">sungnyung</a>, scorched rice tea, which i had for the first time with d&#39;s family at a sundubu restaurant in LA and which was delicious. i&#39;m thankful d and i had enough restraint on friday night not to eat any of the gelato i&#39;d bought because we were full, and i&#39;m thankful the tiny plastic spoon we were using to eat it last night broke halfway through the carton, which created enough distance from the golden peanut butter chocolate binge for us to stop and save the rest for tonight.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for <i>wildheart</i> by miguel and <i>a new place to drown</i> by archy marshall, which have, i think, a kind of kinship of palette and technique and relationship to the previous albums by their creators. i&#39;m thankful that though i don&#39;t think i like either of them as much as the previous albums by their creators, maybe because they lose some of the lightness and joy which are my key musical values and which were infused into the melancholic space of the previous albums, i still respect the albums as artistic steps that they took. i&#39;m thankful that they&#39;re trying different things  and releasing things rather than feeling stuck in the ruts of a sound. i&#39;m thankful for their old songs, too, though. i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-BW2gKnVz8\">do you</a>&quot;

i&#39;m thankful for the authority and power of that statement, for the reassurance it provides, and also for the next sentence after it, which, after that grand pronouncement, i find hilarious in its specificity: &quot;<i>as for you, agnes, you have a peculiar and unusual gift and you have so far used about one third of your talen</i>t.&quot;

but as a series of concrete instants of experience, my perception of it changed. i&#39;m thankful for the perspective to see that on this &quot;bad day,&quot; lots of nice things happened to me and there were a plethora of small slices of time when i was perfectly content. i&#39;m thankful for the presence of mind to recognize nice moments in the course of my day and set down traces of them in notes to be able to remind myself later that my life is usually okay (and often wonderful) even when, because of unfortunate reactions in my brain chemistry, it feels like it isn&#39;t.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to be reminded of the moment near the end of <i>infinite jest</i> where gately is undergoing constant, unimaginable pain in his hospital bed and realizes that the only way to bear it without painkillers is to subdivide time into smaller and smaller segments, to avoid losing himself in a hope-destroying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect\">droste effect</a> future spiral but instead to stay with the present, to focus on each second of survival of the pain of being alive as an accomplishment, to think &quot;this pain is so terrible, but i bore it for this second and i&#39;m still here, and now another second of this terrible pain has gone by and i&#39;m still here, and now another second of the pain has gone by&quot;

and its meaning to one of the visiting lecturers. i&#39;m thankful for the shared glance of bemusement that i had with an IT person as she dealt with a difficult client. i&#39;m thankful for my new short hair, especially after i take showers at the gym at lunch. i&#39;m thankful, though they are dangerously for my self-discipline and diet, for the cornucopia of delicious baked goods that continue to arrive at the office. i&#39;m thankful for the enormous tub of caramel corn that d gave me as an early christmas present. i&#39;m thankful that even though i scorched the brown rice again, we had enough cauliflower for me to grate to go with our leftover bibimbap and it was actually maybe even better than the brown rice would have been. i&#39;m thankful that though i stupidly left the leftovers of the leftover bibimbap on the counter for several hours after dinner &quot;to cool,&quot; there wasn&#39;t that much of it left to spoil and we have pasta to eat. i&#39;m thankful that the blinking red light on the back of my bike, which i keep forgetting to turn off when i lock it up in the morning, has not died. i&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to stop writing this email to go turn it off now.<br><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div>\n\n",

swinging her arms up and down, you gave me this disturbed look, like the facial equivalent of &quot;what the fuck is wrong with you?&quot; i took this look as a sign that we had rudely intruded on your space and d and i quickly said goodbye and went across the hall. as soon as we had closed our door, i was struck, as if by lightning, by the epiphany that your child was a boy named noah and that the reason you were disturbed was that, to me, she was a girl named betsy. in the dream, i collapsed with spasms of painful laughter intense enough to wake me up</i>.&quot;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful for eos brand lip balm, which i think is the best-tasting lip balm and which comes in a container which is pleasing both to look at and to touch. i&#39;m thankful that d&#39;s addiction to lip balm means there is one of them in basically every room of our house. i&#39;m thankful for the chocolate caramels a faculty member gave me as a christmas present. i&#39;m thankful for the revelation that my manager, who has never struck me as a history buff, is obsessed with john f. kennedy and likes to watch tv documentaries about him and compare them to what she&#39;s learned from books she&#39;s read about him. i&#39;m thankful that that made me think of <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/240258\">that eileen myles poem</a>.</span><br></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful that after a month of accumulation of layers of paper and crud, i finally had time to clean off my desk at work. i&#39;m thankful for the clean plane of empty space, for the soft fluorescent highlights. i&#39;m thankful that when my coworker gave me her login credentials so i could send a mass email from her account while she&#39;s on vacation, i completely resisted the desire to snoop. </span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful for the two girls in the gym who were jumping invisible jump-ropes on the sidelines of the basketball court. i&#39;m thankful for their commitment to the illusion, for the way their wrists turned as they swung the ropes.</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>\n\n",

now i&#39;ll really make you squirm / i&#39;ma take a little egg and fertilize it with my sperm / i inject that shit inside, you feel it squirming like a worm / and you best fucking believe you&#39;re gonna carry it to term / no exceptions - my weapon&#39;s your rejection of a preference / for a mother to decide if she wants to ride or die / your body&#39;s mine now, you&#39;re my spouse, the bible says / it&#39;s my house, and when contractions start, the baby&#39;s / gonna rip your balls out. opinions are like assholes / especially from you, son, and if i hear another / i&#39;ll tear you a new one...&quot; </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for duets between louis armstrong and ella fitzgerald, which always make me feel like i&#39;m in the happy coda of a nora ephron movie. i&#39;m thankful for the christmas playlist that an old friend of d&#39;s made and that we are listening to now in our bedroom as the furnace pumps hot air up from the basement. i&#39;m thankful for the flaming lips &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0iW7TAJQSg\">christmas laughing waltz (including jingle bells)</a>,&quot; which matches beautiful meditative close mic-ed jazz piano with a bed of delayed and distorted and reverbed wordless vocalizations. i&#39;m thankful for the latest issue of <i>new york magazine</i>, which is my favorite magazine to read in bed on lazy weekend mornings. i&#39;m thankful for warm matcha frothed in a glass bottle. i&#39;m thankful that our favorite restaurant in town reopened last night and that we&#39;re going to eat there tonight. i&#39;m thankful for all the possibilities which exist in the outline of the weekend ahead of us and in the vast expanse of space-time that will be our holiday vacation, which starts next wednesday.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the singing bowl that d gave me as an early christmas present (i&#39;m thankful also that she likes the hanging air planters that i gave her as an early christmas present). i&#39;m happy that though i had trouble with it at first, i found lists of tips and a helpful tutorial video on the internet. i&#39;m happy for the moment last night when, after seemingly forever fruitlessly rubbing the wooden wand around the outer rim, a piercing, clear tone started to sustain in the bowl and, as i continued to summon it, to rise in pitch and volume, seeming to float out of the bowl in front of me as a tangible object for several moments before my arms gave up and it disappeared into the air. i&#39;m thankful for the way that the process felt like the sonic equivalent of starting a fire with sticks.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIxfRsD560w\">new world coming</a>&quot; by nina simone.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful for that we went to the art museum on the last weekend before the fall exhibition closes. i&#39;m thankful for the <a href=\"https://artmuseum.indiana.edu/media-kits/robertbarnes.html\">exhibition</a>, which introduced me to an incredible painter i had never heard of before. i&#39;m thankful to reject the prejudice i had when i was younger about &quot;local art,&quot; to realize that you don&#39;t have to live in paris or london or new york to make meaningful or beautiful things. i&#39;m thankful that marcel duchamp told the painter to think of the canvas as a theatrical space and i&#39;m thankful that the painter took that to heart. i&#39;m thankful for his large oils and for how they reward prolonged viewing from different distances. i&#39;m thankful for the layered chaos of his compositions, for the way that planes of space skew and shift and intersect and dissolve into each other, and i&#39;m thankful for his facture, for the control (and the (simulation of?) the lack thereof) of the various ways with which he puts paint and pastel on canvas. i&#39;m thankful for the darkness of his color palette, which makes his frequent use of oranges and reds all the more radiant. <div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the wall text, even though wall text seems always to be a subject of criticism these days for over-explaining paintings. i&#39;m thankful, as a writer, to have allusions to history and myth and biography and critical discourse briefly unpacked and to be able to assemble maps of concepts and language in my mind as my eyes travel over the surface of the work, even if this isn&#39;t the &quot;right way&quot; to look at a painting. i&#39;m thankful for the interesting things i learned from the wall text. i&#39;m thankful to have learned about the concept of <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=o-5VpyGAHSgC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=italy+amulets+brevi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5NoFz-jD7-&amp;sig=MiGcS4X8F43dmqYPUx-zuuzU8QY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjr9-DxOrJAhXM4SYKHQPlCucQ6AEIQDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=italy%20amulets%20brevi&amp;f=false\">brevi</a>, amulets of text worn around the neck in italy, and to have fantasized about a life as a sorcerer of words (i&#39;m thankful to think that perhaps i can use this brevi thing as a twitter bot concept). i&#39;m thankful, this close to christmas, to learn that mistletoe was revered by the druids because it is evergreen and that it&#39;s a parasite. i&#39;m thankful to learn about the &quot;odor of sanctity,&quot; which is an enchanting aroma which is supposed to emanate from the remains of saints. i&#39;m thankful for the wall text making a parenthetical joke with an internet-y exclamation point about how a mystical celtic fish is &quot;the ultimate brain food!&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the line from the wall text of the painter&#39;s rendering of faust, which reads, &quot;the noose on the gallows suggests a scrotum.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that the noose on the gallows does, in fact, suggest a scrotum, and i could have seen that without the wall text, but i&#39;m thankful that the wall text reinforced this reading. <div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for revolving doors. i&#39;m thankful, even though it was cold, that we rode our bikes to the art museum. i&#39;m thankful i locked them both up with the same u lock, which i&#39;ve never done before. i&#39;m thankful that we stopped at the bike shop on the way home and i got new tires put on my bike (another christmas present from d). i&#39;m thankful that, though i was intimidated to enter the bike shop, since i don&#39;t know anything about bikes and it feels kind of like the<i> high fidelity</i> problem and the last time we entered the bike shop, after buying junker bikes at an auction on campus and wanting to get them fixed up to make them rideable, the hipster bike shop guy told me that the bike i had gotten was so crappy that it was not worth spending the money to fix it up to make it rideable. i&#39;m thankful that i had no reason to be intimidated and the bike shop guys were super nice. i&#39;m thankful for the new thin, light tires i got and for how excited i am to take a ride on them. i&#39;m thankful for the pony-tail weirdo who kept talking to one of the bike shop guys at a pace which just listening to it made me feel manic and who would not stop using the word &quot;carabiner.&quot;</div></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that when a mingus song came up on the spotify playlist, i introduced d to the <a href=\"http://mingusmingusmingus.com/mingus/cat-traning-program\">charles mingus cat toilet training program.</a> (and i&#39;m thankful to have been reminded of how my grandparents tried (and failed) to teach their over-stuffed miniature dog to go to the bathroom on a piece of astroturf in their kitchen (i&#39;m thankful for the comfort that the ridiculous dog gave my grandmother as she died of cancer)). i&#39;m thankful to have listened to <i>ballads</i> by grant green while we got dressed for dinner. i&#39;m thankful for soft organ beds and for gentle solos. i&#39;m thankful that we got to the restaurant at 5:30 and it didn&#39;t open until 6, so we went to a bar nearby for beers. i&#39;m thankful for the beers we ordered and for the moment when we asked our waitress for a recommendation (something i rarely do) of something interesting and she suggested barleywine, which she said would be &quot;really weird.&quot; i&#39;m thankful it was really weird, but in a tasty way. i&#39;m thankful that after we finished it and went over to the restaurant, they had just opened and we were their second table ever. i&#39;m thankful they seated us by the front window of the restaurant and we could look out on the white christmas lights strung around the town square. i&#39;m thankful for our waitress, who was super friendly, especially given the chaos of a restaurant opening, and who reminded me strongly of amy schumer. i&#39;m thankful for oysters and mingonette and lemon juice. i&#39;m thankful for pickled onions. i&#39;m thankful for the ecstasy of yellowfin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poke_(fish_salad)\">poke</a>, even if ours was maybe slightly over-salted. i&#39;m thankful for an incredibly subtle wash of wasabi, and i&#39;m thankful for microgreens. &#39;m thankful that instead of an entree, we got two desserts. i&#39;m thankful for thick, bitter chocolate mousse with a sugar-lacquered sesame accessory cracker that reminded us of korea. i&#39;m thankful for bright, bracing grapefruit sorbet and for the fact that it had whipped cream on it, which i&#39;ve never had or thought to have with sorbet, but which was actually good. i&#39;m thankful for whipped cream, which is honestly probably good on everything. </div></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for our euphoric stumble home through the cold. i&#39;m thankful how even though we like to stay home almost all the time, it was nice, and i&#39;m thankful for how halfway through the evening, we kind of realized we were on a date. i&#39;m thankful for the fun &quot;date conversations&quot; we had, about our parents and books and things we could remember from college. i&#39;m thankful that the bill was lower than we had expected it to be. i&#39;m thankful, as we approached the house from the street, for the way the colored lights on our christmas tree made a watercolor abstract expressionism of the blinds on our front window. i&#39;m thankful for how nice it was to enter a warm house after walking through the cold. i&#39;m thankful for <i>the expanse</i>, which we started watching after i saw a comparison on slate to <i>battlestar galactica</i>, which was enough for me, and which is pretty great so far (but, so far, seems more intimate than <i>galactica</i>, and reminds me more of <i>seveneves</i>). i&#39;m thankful for <i>battlestar galactica</i> and i&#39;m thankful for <i>seveneves </i>and for everyone&#39;s excitement about the new <i>star wars</i>, which i&#39;m thankful has not been spoiled for me yet and which we will probably see sometime this week. i&#39;m thankful for the old vhs camcorder that my dad had, which, as a child, i once used to watch the entirety of <i>the empire strikes back</i> while lying on my stomach on the carpeted floor of a temporary bedroom in a short-term rental, my face shoved up against the rubber eyepiece to be able to see the viewfinder&#39;s image of a galaxy far, far away. i&#39;m thankful for the soft paper lights in the shape of stars we have hanging over the head of our bed and how their gentle astronomy guides us toward sleep.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful that there was a problem with cell signals traveling through the air when i went running through the thick gray morning yesterday and so neither my podcasts nor spotify were working and i had to listen to the only music i had on my phone, which was <i>1989</i>. i&#39;m thankful, despite quietly appreciating the undeniable &quot;you belong with me&quot; when it came out, that i didn&#39;t really like taylor swift for a long time and in fact actively disliked her for a while. i&#39;m thankful that when <i>1989</i> first came out, i didn&#39;t really see the appeal and gently mocked d for buying a CD from target rather than just torrenting it. i&#39;m thankful for the occasionally heated debates we had sitting on our apartment floor when i felt the need to set up lana del rey and/or beyonce (who we both loved) in a binary with tay-tay (who only she loved) as a way of enumerating their superiority to her, even though that was stupid and unnecessary and she was right. i&#39;m thankful that despite my grumbling, d just kept playing the album because she loved it so much, in the apartment and in the car and in hotel rooms and on her laptop, and i kept listening to it, less and less grudgingly and then more and more enthusiastically. i&#39;m thankful that over time, i was able to get past my initial resistance to the production, to this modern pop tendency for massed synths and harmonies and for everything to need to feel &quot;epic,&quot; and against my even stronger resistance to taylor&#39;s persona, the constructed good girl perfection of which seemed antithetical to the kind of musical personas i generally prefer (which are usually rooted in &quot;coolness&quot; and &quot;danger&quot; and some kernel of rockist authenticity, even if they are playing with/stretching that concept, as, for ex., lana del rey does). <div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that even if i roll my eyes occasionally at taylor now, i do so with affection. i&#39;m thankful i now find reading her social media and watching her cat videos and reading about her in profiles makes me happy, i&#39;m thankful to check in with her, and i&#39;m even more thankful for how much i&#39;ve come to appreciate the album. i&#39;m thankful how i still like hearing it in the car or in my headphones. i&#39;m thankful that the song that i initially found the most hunger games ridiculous, &quot;i know places,&quot; is actually my favorite song to run to now. i&#39;m thankful for its ferocity and for the way that the ryan tedder super-choruses slam in, giving me bursts of speed. i&#39;m thankful for the way the neurochemical intensity of running can sync up to music to make me cry sometimes while running even if i&#39;m not (consciously) sad. i&#39;m thankful for the thrumming catharsis of that.<div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that after d fell asleep trying to watch the second episode of <i>the expanse </i>with me last night after dinner, we left outer space to watch the <i>1989</i> concert film. i&#39;m thankful for my/our disappointment in the aesthetic of the special, for the way that the overcaffeinated editing and the weird figure skating costume mediocrity &quot;let&#39;s put on a show&quot; theater geek sense of it made me appreciate both taylor&#39;s videos (especially the &quot;style&quot; video, which i think is totally exquisite digital psych abercrombie porn) and beyonce&#39;s completely flawless video album even more (so i guess i still haven&#39;t abandoned that binary and i&#39;m thankful that i can cling to its wreckage). i&#39;m thankful that some of the concert rearrangements of her songs were interesting (&quot;trouble&quot; with a devilish drumless opening and an acid guitar solo at the end) and some were ill-advised, even if i can see the logic behind them (&quot;love story&quot; recast as room temperature stadium synth pad pop—never have i missed a fiddle more in my life, even if the exuberance of the key change in the final chorus was still able to push up through the reverb). i&#39;m thankful, despite the lameness of some of the staging and despite how taylor&#39;s &quot;intimate&quot; stadium chats with the audience represented the aspects of her persona that i like least, that the songs are still great and i still enjoyed hearing them sung and i&#39;m thankful that as i lost interest and looked at things on my phone, that d still sang along and i could listen to her voice layering with taylors and the stadium&#39;s. i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s singing voice, and i&#39;m thankful that she turned off the concert film early because she wanted to be able to better focus on a challenge in <i>zelda: a link between two world</i>s, which i gave her as an early christmas present.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for zan romanoff&#39;s <a href=\"http://zanopticon.tumblr.com/post/101231107866/i-love-taylor-swift-so-much-you-guys-a\">writing about taylor swift</a>, which d sent me when she was trying to convince me of how great she is. i&#39;m thankful for the other great things i read this weekend. i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/i-dont-believe-in-god-but-i-believe-in-lithium.html?_r=0\">this essay</a> by jaime lowe about lithium. i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://lithub.com/knausgaard-writes-like-a-woman/\">this essay</a> by siri hustvedt about literary misogyny and knaussgard. i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinchack/for-sarge#.xjQbzrPDR\">this essay</a> by erin chack about love. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m still enjoying <i>the thousand autumns of jacob de zoet</i>. i&#39;m thankful for the rest of that <i>new york magazine</i> was great, even if i&#39;d read a lot of it online already. i&#39;m thankful that d surprised me with another giant tub of caramel corn after i confessed to her that, intending to just have a few pieces of the tub she gave me last week, i had ended up almost eating the whole thing. i&#39;m thankful that i will have lots of time to exercise during vacation. i&#39;m thankful for the old pair of laundry day underwear that had a large hole in the crotch, which i hulkishly ripped off my body to entertain d. i&#39;m thankful that though d and i both passed through clouds of irritability yesterday, we came together to make this <a href=\"http://www.cookmarked.com/recipe/Simple-Lasagna-with-Hearty-TomatoMeat-Sauce-Cooks-Illustrated--viCoCnP9xImNJMSIjd780PIyZ5YTkJfWDnuHpClxiJUe\">delicious lasagna</a>. i&#39;m thankful to look forward to dinner tonight, when we can have more of it. i&#39;m thankful for leftovers.</div></div></div></div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful for how a few months of commuting on my bike has given me access to a whole world of driving feelings that i never experienced in thirty years as a passenger. i&#39;m thankful to now understand how necessary road rage can sometimes feel, after years of not being able to figure out why my dad couldn&#39;t get over asshole drivers and of worrying that the bulging vein in his temple meant he was going to have a heart attack or stroke (i&#39;m thankful that he is more mellow about it now). i&#39;m thankful to finally know what the danger of moving through freshly slick streets feels like viscerally. i&#39;m thankful, as a passenger whose m.o. in a car is always &quot;oh well, it&#39;s okay that we missed that light—we&#39;ll just wait for the next one,&quot; to crank my quads so i can blast through the end of a yellow on my way home and get there thirty seconds sooner. i&#39;m thankful for the way my body knows the rhythms of the traffic lights downtown, thankful to be able to feel, without counting, how much time i have get from one green light to the next to the next before the sequence starts to change. <div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to take pictures of graduating students with their advisors and mentors. i&#39;m thankful to get to say silly things to make them smile more genuinely. i&#39;m thankful that the exuberance of their relief at finishing papers and projects gives me an echo of the feelings of freedom i used to experience when i was a student. i&#39;m thankful that both my bosses loved their christmas gifts and expressed particularly the feeling of being known based on what i&#39;d chosen for them (a mug that says &quot;i&#39;d rather be boating&quot; for one, a bottle of sweet wine and a handful of scratch-off lottery tickets for the other). i&#39;m thankful that the gym by the office is open this holiday season, since it was closed last year and that was annoying. i&#39;m thankful that rather than letting the stray basketball headed toward me at the track pass by yesterday while i was running, i tried to kick it back to its owner on the court, even though i didn&#39;t do a good job and looked stupid. i&#39;m thankful for the old towels being rotated in at the gym this week, which are light brown and smell weirdly like cucumber (whereas the usual towels, which are green, the color of cucumber, do not smell like cucumber). i&#39;m thankful for my work friend t, who just gave me a printed photo of two knit cat butts (with tiny pink knit buttholes) that says &quot;merry christmas&quot; with a candy cane taped to the top. i&#39;m thankful that a faculty member&#39;s son is coming to the office this afternoon and i&#39;ll give him small jobs to make him feel important and then play frisbee with him in the empty gym. i&#39;m thankful i had the foresight to buy him a little christmas present in case i saw him over the holidays and i&#39;m thankful that d wrapped it nicely in shiny blue paper.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for sun salutations, which i must always remember are essential. i&#39;m thankful that i slept on them for the past few weeks in favor of more headstands and warrior and seated forward bends during my daily practice and started gradually feeling like things were getting stale. i&#39;m thankful that yesterday evening, i did them for a half hour straight and felt incredible afterwards, like my body was new to me again rather than the shell of matter it felt like it was becoming. i&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to do more yoga on vacation and to learn new asanas to add to my repertoire.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for <i>keeping up with the kardashians</i>. i&#39;m thankful that the cold open of this week&#39;s episode was an extended scene at a bougie grocery store of kim asking mason&#39;s opinion about the smells of various natural deodorants because her normal deodorant was not holding up to the stresses that pregnancy had exerted on her body. i&#39;m thankful for the beautiful images of st. bart&#39;s, which reminded me of the tropical fantasia in <i>just cause 3</i>, which i played for about two hours on sunday after renting it from redbox. i&#39;m thankful for kris&#39;s exasperated line to kim that &quot;i would never speak to anybody the way you speak to me&quot; and i&#39;m thankful for kim&#39;s devilish child eyes and ridiculous need to impose her will on everyone. i&#39;m thankful for the family&#39;s fears about kourtney being obsessed with intricate instagram stalking and to think that people who are famous still are checking who liked a particular photo and who&#39;s mentioned where (i&#39;m thankful to think about miranda july asking rihanna what apps she had on her phone in that one interview (i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/year-of-the-fanboy-profile-writers-fawning-over-subjec-1748180895\">this essay</a>, which reminded me of that)). i&#39;m thankful for tyga, whose music i have never listened to but who seemed like quite a pleasant and agreeable person to go on vacation with. i&#39;m thankful for how he squirmed uncomfortably on the paddle board in deep clear water, white knuckle gripping the edges</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that today&#39;s lenny letter has a new short story from emma jane unsworth, and i&#39;m thankful that though normally i don&#39;t like or read short stories (which graduate school ruined for me), i did read this one and did like it. i&#39;m thankful for her novel <i>animals</i>, which d read while we were on the beach in miami last year and kept laughing and having to read funny bits to me aloud. i&#39;m thankful for the novel, which i read myself later and which is great. i&#39;m thankful <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nokfromthefuture/up-north-ft-cousin-stizz-night-lovell\">this song</a>, which i came across on soundcloud yesterday while walking home in gray spitting rain. i&#39;m thankful for the synth acoustic guitar plucks and the sampled vocals and the distorted synth and i&#39;m thankful for the way those elements and more are combined by the ADD headphone aesthetic of the producer, for the way new sounds appear in basically every bar but the whole thing still feels minimalist for the most part thanks to constant subtraction accompanying the addition, as well as judicious EQ. i&#39;m thankful to have learned from the <i>new york times</i> daily briefing that the annual christmas lottery is so important in spain that it continued during the spanish civil war, only with two separate drawings, one for republicans and one for fascists.</div></div>\n\n",

japanese commercials of 2015 that we watched. i&#39;m thankful for the anecdote d told me after, which was how KFC really took control of how christmas was marketed in japan when the holiday was starting to become popular and now many people eat KFC on fried chicken or, even if they don&#39;t, associate the holiday with the brand. i&#39;m thankful for her telling me about how her friend who lives in japan doesn&#39;t like fried chicken and how disturbing and wrong we both found this. i&#39;m thankful that writing this will drop a thought anchor in my subconscious about fried chicken and we will probably have it sometime this vacation.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the fun i had working and playing with the faculty member&#39;s son yesterday. i&#39;m thankful for his help emptying out, crushing, and recycling old soda bottles (i&#39;m thankful i saved this task for him and i&#39;m thankful for the great sound the bottles made as we crushed them with our feet). i&#39;m thankful for our science experiment gross-out at a floating culture blob that plopped out of an old jug of sweet tea into the sink in the men&#39;s bathroom (baby kombucha?). i&#39;m thankful that he helped me take down our office christmas decorations (i&#39;m thankful for this gift that we gave to my future self when i return from vacation) and i&#39;m thankful for his glee at using the industrial paper shredder (under careful supervision) to destroy old tests and papers. i&#39;m thankful that after our work was done, we went and played frisbee in a cavernous empty gym. i&#39;m thankful for his joy at making trick shots by bouncing the frisbee off the ground with a sharply angled shot and for the cool throws he made that caused the frisbee to ride along the wall and then drop down for me to catch. i&#39;m thankful my work friend t snuck out of her office to come throw with us for a while. i&#39;m thankful that, seeing me in workout clothes for the first time, she said &quot;damn, justin, you have amazing legs.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the rhythm and variations introduced when you have three people playing frisbee rather than two. i&#39;m thankful for our camaraderie and fun and the way that we all faux-formally shook hands and told each other good game after we finished. i&#39;m thankful the son was surprised by the tiny secret christmas <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flickerz-Flying-Disc-White-Silver/dp/B00BLDFQ86\">present</a> i bought him, which is a tiny plastic frisbee you flick with your fingers.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful, despite my anxiety about videophones, that we had a wonderful skype with our friend jk in seoul. i&#39;m thankful that in a lot of ways, it was just like the old days. i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://declineofscarcity.com/?page_id=2527\">this passage</a> from <i>infinite jest</i> about videophones and anxiety that i sent jk and d in the morning before the call. i&#39;m thankful for her toddler daughter, who was wearing confetti patterned leggings and who connected through the screen and across the globe with d&#39;s puppycat plush, babbled adorably, spun an office chair, turned the laptop to find a new composition, and then ended the call after an hour or so by closing the computer and shutting it down. i&#39;m thankful for how much skype has improved since i last used it, when i was the one living in korea; i&#39;m thankful that the lag was almost imperceptible. i&#39;m thankful to get to catch up with jk, who we miss very much, to be able to exchange gossip and talk about tv shows and art and books.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the <a href=\"https://tinyletter.com/griefbacon\">grief bacon</a> tinyletter, which i came to through <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/forwards/letters/fwd-malls\">tinyletter forwards</a> and which has been great so far and had an especially great letter yesterday about what it feels like to be in new york during the holidays. i&#39;m thankful to remember d and i&#39;s first trip to new york one christmas a few years ago, our first trip together as a couple, which i didn&#39;t want to go on because of (partly) a fear of spending money and a (mostly) fear of the unknown. i&#39;m thankful for the revelation that was taking a slow cab down from laguardia  through harlem and the upper east side to our tiny boutique hotel room south of the park, for the fact that all i could dumbstruck say was that it reminded me of <i>GTA IV</i>. i&#39;m thankful for the dark polished surfaces of the hotel, for the expensive textures, and for the colors and shapes we could see out our window, especially at surnise, which reminds me in retrospect of an <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ashc/hd_ashc.htm\">ashcan school</a> landscape, even though i hadn&#39;t studied the ashcan school at that point (on our second trip to new york, we would see a <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/bellows\">george bellows</a> show at the met after i had studied him and his depictions of a snowy city in warm light would give me a powerful sense of deja vu). i&#39;m thankful to remember walking through little italy on our first night after a dinner of sichuan frog legs and feeling completely overwhelmed by the crowded sidewalks and a guy with a family who was headed in the opposite direction, telling me in a stereotypical tv new jersey voice, &quot;hey buddy, it&#39;s christmas, how about a smile?&quot; and this command crushing my spirits even further so that my face crumpled and i almost cried and he looked embarrassed he&#39;d said anything. i&#39;m thankful for our subway mishaps and triumphs and long walks down the avenues. i&#39;m thankful to remember my first trip to moma and the guggenheim and my first time eating dim sum, which changed my culinary life and in itself would have made the trip worth it. i&#39;m thankful for my favorite art exhibition i have maybe ever seen (though the travelling magritte show at the chicago institute of art is close competition), which was this incredible retrospective at ps1 of an artist i had never heard of, <a href=\"http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/363\">thomas lanigan-schmidt</a>. i&#39;m thankful for the agony and ecstasy of his work, for all the ways he used text in images, which inspired me to fill pages of a notebook with ideas that i never followed through on, and for his embrace of foil and glitter and magic markers and saran wrap and the way he elevated those materials until they became holy, sanctified. i&#39;m thankful for how hot we were walking through the museum in our coats because we were afraid to check them, and how that warmth lent a certain intensity to the experience. i&#39;m thankful for the james turrell room that&#39;s open to the sky, which was so refreshing with its blast of cold air and natural light. i&#39;m thankful that coming across on the top floor of the museum at the end of an anonymous hallway felt like coming across a secret and that when we entered, there was no one else around for a long while, so it was like the sky belonged to us. i&#39;m thankful how, so we could rest our feet after the workout of traversing the galleries before we headed back to manhattan, we stepped into the theater downstairs and, watched a half hour or so of pasolini&#39;s <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal%C3%B2,_or_the_120_Days_of_Sodom\">salo</a></i>, which was just as insane as i&#39;d always heard it was. i&#39;m thankful for getting quite drunk in our hotel room before and after dinners and taking pages of fuzzy selfies. i&#39;m thankful for channel surfing late one evening while exhausted in bed and coming across <i>dune</i>. i&#39;m thankful for the furry hat with ear flaps that i got at the giant forever 21 in times square and continue to wear in the winter to this day, though the faux fur is now quite matted. i&#39;m thankful for how momofuku was less than we&#39;d expected and times square was more than we&#39;d expected. i&#39;m thankful for our time sitting on a bench in central park on an unseasonably warm morning waiting for the museum of natural history to open. i&#39;m thankful for how sad i felt when the trip was over and the cab driver was dropping me off at my terminal at laguardia so i could fly to miami before taking d to a different terminal so she could fly to san diego. i&#39;m thankful for the intensity of how much i missed her while sitting there in my terminal waiting for my flight, how deeply her absence strained my heart.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that though that trip was in many ways as stressful as it was wonderful, it made the next trip (when we stayed at a weird hasid hotel in williamsburg) less stressful and more wonderful, and i&#39;m thankful, that though i&#39;m so happy we&#39;re staying home together this winter, to get to fantasize about all the trips we will take someday. i&#39;m thankful for how the space that vacation creates is not just about the freedom you&#39;re experiencing in the present, but about the way it allows your mind to envision, in optimistic soft focus, what the future might be like.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful for <i><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/303210/\">the beginner&#39;s guide</a></i>, a video game i played yesterday afternoon which was one of the most moving artistic experiences i&#39;ve had in a long time. i&#39;m thankful for the singularity and power of its architecture, both conceptually (the ideas, the sentences, the narrative) and physically (the ominous towers, the deconstructed prisons, the winding paths). i&#39;m thankful for the echoes the game sounded of alan resnais and jenny holzer and john baldessari and carl andre and james turrell. i&#39;m thankful for the creator&#39;s voice-over narration, for his exploration of what it is to create things and why people create them and what the things can mean or say about their creators. i&#39;m thankful, as i consider what it feels like to have people read my daily thoughts, for the questions he asks about audiences and motivation and interpretation. i&#39;m thankful for the darkness of the game, for its avoidance of easy answers to any of these questions, for the way that the two kinds of architecture i described before (and the two kinds of darkness shrouding that architecture) are united in service of movement and meditation. i&#39;m thankful for the way that the stark minimalism of the design shows how powerful simple interactions (a switch that opens a door) and symbols (a lamppost, a set of dots on a wall, a maze) can be made through iteration and repetition, through small but significant variations. i&#39;m thankful that humans evolved to recognize patterns and ascribe meaning to them, even if this blessing is also, as the game shows, a curse. <div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for how hard it rained yesterday, for the fury of the thunder and lightning as it struck all around the house. i&#39;m thankful that though there was a tornado warning, there weren&#39;t any tornados. i&#39;m thankful that though d&#39;s umbrella broke yesterday morning, it broke at the very end of our errands, between the car and the back door, so she didn&#39;t get soaked. i&#39;m thankful to get to be inside a warm house all day while it rains hard and dark outside, which always reminds me of happy times when i was a child.<br><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the bittersweetness of the tension that i&#39;m often struck by after being deeply moved by an experience, which is an inability to decide whether it&#39;s more satisfying to try to keep the experience of the thing resonating quietly inside of me by being still and leaving it alone and not complicating it with further thought or, on the other hand, whether to unlock my device and go off in search of more (images, interviews, descriptions, depictions, digressions, anything) that i can pull in out of the web to expand the experience and make it continue in that way, paths branching off into an infinite horizon of results. i&#39;m thankful to think of how, when struck by this feeling when i was a young child, i had no device for unlocking experiences in this way (save for some small objects made out of plastic and the occasional paperback movie novelization) and so was forced to use my imagination to sustain the tidal feelings of art washing over the inside of my body (i&#39;m thankful, though, not to let nostalgica color this too warmly, and to remember the times when i felt a deep lack of more). i&#39;m thankful to remember when i was in college and went to the movies on campus a lot with my friends and how, after a good movie, i would feel unable to talk about it, would just walk home a few steps behind the others in the peace of darkness until i felt that i had digested the experience (like you would digest a meal) and was ready to come back to the world. i&#39;m thankful that, though my inclination these days, like a lot of people, is usually to unlock and search and stream about the thing that moved me, that sometimes that impulse, contrary to what cultural critics crow about in op-eds, is rewarding and sometimes even magical, can unlock new rooms which i can enter and consider the thing from different perspectives, can reactivate the magic of the thing by way of interfaces that were hidden from me as i experienced it the first time. i&#39;m thankful, even, for the times that this impulse to connect the dots backfires on me, as it often does, because, for example, i read a commentary that seems to misunderstand what the thing meant to me, or to critique exactly what it was that i found moving, or to pervert something i my subconscious found beautiful by using words to make that beauty explicit to me (the colors that were pure in shadow becoming garish in the light), that those experiences of diminishment are powerful and valid, too, and maybe even sometimes necessary (though i&#39;m also thankful that the next time i experience a moving thing, i sometimes faintly remember a bad experience like this and use it as an omen to stay away from searching). i&#39;m thankful, again, for the singing bowl that d gave me for christmas, which seems like a useful tangible metaphor for trying to sustain a powerful inner feeling.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that the company i freelanced for a month or so ago asked me yesterday whether i&#39;d like to write another post for them. i&#39;m thankful, even though my first inclination was to say no (is always to say no) and even though i had been fantasizing since thanksgiving of letting my vacation be a place where work doesn&#39;t exist, i said yes, that i would send over some pitches soon. i&#39;m thankful to build out my resume with experiences which will hopefully make me more employable in the future. i&#39;m thankful that after dinner last night, i got out my computer and started thinking in an email draft and i&#39;m thankful that an hour later, i had three pitches that i was happy with and i clicked send. i&#39;m thankful that it didn&#39;t feel that hard (i&#39;m thankful to knock on wood after writing that) and i&#39;m thankful that maybe writing these notes is helping and will help me write other things. i&#39;m thankful that over night (because he lives in thailand), the editor accepted one of my pitches and i&#39;m thankful that i feel like the post will be both fun to write and useful for people to read.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the phone game <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwij172ixfTJAhVENSYKHe1CAhIQFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ridiculousfishing.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFY4c65amZFnHVkDF75ztp9usvHbw&amp;sig2=a3rGjo9T-wuzm3xi7fEykQ&amp;bvm=bv.110151844,d.eWE\">r<i>idiculous fishing</i></a>, which is not profound like <i>the beginner&#39;s guide</i> but which is, in terms of <a href=\"http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=2982\">core loops</a>, profoundly satisfying (i&#39;m thankful for the linked essay, from one of my favorite internet writers, which is an example of a result that can expand your experience of a thing). i&#39;m thankful i downloaded it on a whim yesterday evening after dinner, while d navigated a zelda dungeon in the living room. i&#39;m thankful that though i intended to only check it out for a few minutes before doing some yoga, i ended up playing for almost an hour. i&#39;m thankful for the fun mechanics, for the excellent use of the accelerometer, for the gleeful chiptune sonatas. i&#39;m thankful that eventually i was able to pull myself away and do a set of sun salutations. </div></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s not going to rain today and that we&#39;re going to go on a long walk across town. i&#39;m thankful that we haven&#39;t decided what to make for dinner tonight. i&#39;m thankful that tomorrow is christmas.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful that we were late to <i>star wars. </i>i&#39;m thankful<i> </i>that when we entered the theater, sure that the pre-show trailers would still be playing, instead, we were met by the the thundering brass fanfare of the overture and the crawl of yellow text scrolling away across an endless starfield. i&#39;m thankful, when we entered our theater and realized the movie had already started, for how primally dark it was, for how when i took a step away from d to try to find a row with empty seats, she was completely lost in the vast black and i had to reach out blindly to find her warm arm again.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for these things because the origin story, as it were, of my parents&#39; relationship (and, therefore, my origin story, in a way), involves my parents in high school going, on their first date, to see <i>the empire strikes back </i>just after it was released. i&#39;m thankful for the story, oft-repeated in family lore, of how my dad was stressed out and annoyed through the beginning of the date because they were running late and by the time they entered the theatre, the movie had already started, laser beams zipping over the icy expanse of hoth, walkers in the distance. i&#39;m thankful for the punchline of the story, which is that my mom felt bad about making them late to the movie until it became clear, as they talked afterward, that my dad <i>had already seen</i> <i>the movie</i> and that this was his second viewing. i&#39;m thankful for my dad&#39;s ridiculousness (which, as i get older, becomes clearer and clearer is also my ridiculousness, a genetic inheritance) and my mom&#39;s love for that ridiculousness most of the time and for her saintly ability to tolerate it even when she doesn&#39;t love it. i&#39;m thankful that their first date wasn&#39;t their last date.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful, as d and i walked across town yesterday morning to the crappy movie theater by the old mall (it takes about an hour and fifteen minutes) to see the new <i>star wars</i>, i reminded her of this story in a joking way. i&#39;m thankful for the moment later in the trip, when we were hustling along a suburban street so as to hopefully not miss many of the trailers, how impressed i was at the speed of her power walking. i&#39;m thankful that unlike my dad, who was late to a movie he thought was important decades before the invention of prozac, i didn&#39;t really care that we were late to the movie, even though i was excited about seeing it and even though i don&#39;t normally like being late for things. i&#39;m thankful that when we arrived, though it seemed like our eyes would never adjust well enough to the darkness for us to be able to find seats, eventually they did and we did. i&#39;m thankful that as i groped along a row near the center of the seating, still heavily visually impaired, i didn&#39;t accidentally run into anyone because the row i had picked turned out to be empty (i&#39;m thankful i didn&#39;t follow my first instinct and try going one row back, where there turned out to be a large group of people). i&#39;m thankful that though d didn&#39;t follow me down the row as i thought she did and that she felt briefly alone and scared standing in the aisle, she was soon able to see me motioning to her and make her way to the seat beside me. i&#39;m thankful that d and i are both short and quiet, so hopefully we didn&#39;t ruin the first shot of the new <i>star wars </i>for anyone by trying to get to our seats for the journey across the galaxy.</div></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that the new <i>star wars</i> was so great. i&#39;m thankful that for d, who doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s seen any of the original trilogy, though she has hazy memories of yoda training luke on dagobah, the new <i>star wars</i> was so great. i&#39;m thankful that for me, who watched the original trilogy millions of times as a child, the new <i>star wars</i> was so great. i&#39;m thankful for the beautiful grinning energy of john boyega, especially, but also for the smiles and grunts and grimaces, the leaps and feints, of daisy ridley and oscar isaac and even adam driver, whose performance was so good and interesting that it almost just made me forget his character from <i>girls </i>while watching him<i> </i>(though that required cognitive strain and i think it would be better if he just wore the mask almost all the time). i&#39;m thankful for the sweetness and the humor, which are self-reflexive and winking and joyful without ever descending into the meaninglessly whedonesque. i&#39;m thankful for the genius with which the movie recapitulates scenes and images and ideas and narrative threads from the original without feeling like it&#39;s rehashing them, how it absorbs the essence and projects it into the body of the present. i&#39;m thankful for the magic trick light touch of the illusions and the allusions.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the weird experience i had in the bathroom halfway through the movie when i left to pee. i&#39;m thankful that, for some reason, this movie theater&#39;s men&#39;s bathroom doesn&#39;t have any mirrors, so that as you wash your hands, you aren&#39;t able to see your own image. i&#39;m thankful to fantasize that this is not because the mirrors broke or for any kind of banal practical reason, but for art&#39;s sake, to allow you to stay locked in the world of the film you&#39;re watching rather than confronting your self, the afterimages projecting from your eyes onto the screen of the blank concrete wall. i&#39;m thankful, after listening to the adorable puppyish burbles and bleeps of bb88, watching roll across the dunes of jakku, for the moment when i stuck my hands under the motion-sensor paper towel dispenser. i&#39;m thankful for the slight delay as the black box&#39;s sensors recognized my presence and then the almost animal mechanical whine of it unspooling a segment of brown paper for me to take. i&#39;m thankful how for a moment, rather than being a banal convenience, another meaningless product, the machine made me feel like i was living in the future.</div></div>\n\n",

things, felt freed to do so and had the idea). i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s mom&#39;s excitement about her new michael kors bag which she had been wanting for a long time and which she leapt from the couch to model for us in a rapid fire variety of positions. i&#39;m thankful for my mom&#39;s excitement about <i>the food lab</i> cookbook i bought her, and thankful for her texts throughout the day about interesting things she&#39;d learned from it. i&#39;m thankful for my brother&#39;s excitement about <i>fire emblem awakening</i>, which d got him because she loved it so much and thought he would too. i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s sister&#39;s excitement at the makeup set d got her and i&#39;m thankful that, as promised, she wore her <a href=\"http://kigurumi-shop.com/\">kigurumi</a> which was beyond cute and had fur claws. i&#39;m thankful that d got a kigurumi of her own for christmas as a surprise gift and that she put it on immediately to show off and also looks adorable in it. i&#39;m thankful that i got a new set of nonstick skillets for the kitchen so we can stop possibly ingesting toxic chemicals when i use them. i&#39;m thankful for the annual ritual of watching my dog crawl into her enormous stocking to retrieve her gifts—i&#39;m thankful for how much she liked the stuffed possum she was given. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that d and i both have families (and now both have each others&#39; families) that love us so much and i&#39;m thankful that we were able to connect with them on an important day. i&#39;m thankful, even though i&#39;m a person that thrives on routine, for the way that holidays can sometimes disrupt routines for the better. i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6t47RI4bns\">blessings on blessings on blessings</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that after the bustle of unwrapping, we cleaned the house so that it would be nice for us for the rest of our vacation (or at least for a little while). i&#39;m thankful that though for some reason, it did not feel good to be in my body/mind yesterday afternoon (possibly because i took my prozac late because i was on the video phone calls, possibly the exertion of emotional effort to be present through the screen, possibly not having time to do yoga or meditate, possibly some subconscious feelings of guilt at being away, possibly any number of other things created by the mysteries of the processes of the body that are totally outside of my control), i forced myself to go running and it was a beautiful warm sunny day. i&#39;m thankful for the &#39;do not enter&#39; sign i passed whose paint was almost entirely faded, erasing its warning. i&#39;m thankful that i encountered the large tree which had fallen across the path while running instead of while biking—i&#39;m thankful for the joy of jumping over it and barely breaking my stride as i continued. i&#39;m thankful that by the time i got home, i was feeling better. i&#39;m thankful that i discovered the power of exercise to help me feel better at a relatively young age. i&#39;m thankful that d texted me while i was gone to check on me and that i responded immediately that i was fine and would be home in five minutes. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that we had leftover shrimp scampi with linguini to eat for dinner and i&#39;m thankful that i decided not to bother with a salad, which would just be a distraction from the pasta. i&#39;m thankful that after dinner, while d played zelda, i started watching <i>nymphomaniac: volume 1</i>, which i&#39;ve had saved in my netflix queue for a long time but couldn&#39;t make myself watch. i&#39;m thankful for lars von trier&#39;s masterly command of the brechtian alienation effect and i&#39;m thankful, at the same time, for the beauty of the photography. i&#39;m thankful for the artificially imposed literary device used to structure the narratives, for the weird role played by stellan skarsgard as a delivery mechanism for facts about fly fishing and polyphony. i&#39;m thankful for the quality of the performances, even with actors like christian slater and shia le boeuf, who initially felt like stunt casting but who really delivered. i&#39;m thankful for the sadness of the movie, especially in the scene with uma thurman (which is also very funny) and the scene where christian slater dies of delirium tremens (which is not funny). i&#39;m thankful that d eventually got so intrigued by the movie that she put away her game and we turned off the lights and embraced while watching the end. i&#39;m thankful that as we sat there, i thought of the ending of <i>melancholia</i>, when the family huddles together under the makeshift structure made of sticks, united as the world ends around them.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful for my first massage. i&#39;m thankful that when i gave d a gift certificate for a local spa for christmas, she insisted that instead of getting a fancy facial or long massage, as i intended, that we split it and each have a short massage. i&#39;m thankful that she said it was more important to her that we get to share the experience. i&#39;m thankful that though i worried that we were going to be late for our appointment, we were right on time. i&#39;m thankful for the weird dimly lit purgatorial &quot;tranquility room&quot; we waited in while we filled out forms and drew on outlines of the human body where we wanted to be massaged the most. i&#39;m thankful that my masseuse, l, was a nice older woman who reminded me of one of my grandmother&#39;s friends when i was growing up. i&#39;m thankful that, learning that i had never had a massage, l very clearly warmly explained the process. i&#39;m thankful that once i had stripped down and laid under the blanket and put my face into the padded receptacle, i didn&#39;t have to open my eyes or say anything else for the next half hour.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the strangeness of the bodily intimacy of getting a massage. i&#39;m thankful that the only reference point for being touched in that way is sex, or the occasional massages that d and i will give each other, but that this is different, because when i&#39;m giving d a massage, even if i&#39;m concentrating very diligently on making her feel good (or, if she&#39;s unwell, feel better), my own arousal, because of my love for her and for her body, is always an undercurrent to the process (and an undercurrent that sometimes becomes a current and then a wave). i&#39;m thankful for how, at the spa, having l&#39;s hands laid on me didn&#39;t feel sexual (though i did get a semi as she worked her elbow into the sides of my hips) or medical (my only other context for being touched without clothes, since i&#39;ve never really done sports) but weirdly spiritual, in a way. i&#39;m thankful to think sacrilegiously of mm washing j&#39;s feet and to wonder whether she gave him a massage while rubbing them. i&#39;m thankful for the strangeness of l using not just her hands, but her forearms and elbows, for how i didn&#39;t expect that her forearms would be her primary tool (i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s comparison, after the fact, of her masseuse&#39;s similar moves to a &quot;human rolling pin&quot;). i&#39;m thankful for maybe my favorite move l did, which was to drive her elbow up along my back and through the knots in my shoulder, culminating in lodging it for a second in the bowl between my shoulder and kneck and creating an uncanny feeling, like when someone &quot;cracks an egg&quot; over your head. i&#39;m thankful for the dark soft room and the weird harold budd in middle earth soundtrack. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that my forecast app told me it wasn&#39;t raining and wouldn&#39;t rain and then when i went outside to go running, it rained the whole time. i&#39;m thankful that the rain wasn&#39;t heavy but was everpresent. i&#39;m thankful i wore a waterproof jacket even though it wasn&#39;t supposed to rain. i&#39;m thankful, as i ran through the rain, for the opportunity the weather app&#39;s inadequacy gave me to think about why it might have failed (is the amount of precipitation that triggers the &quot;light rain&quot; label an amount greater than 0? what is the rain that is not &quot;rain&quot;?). i&#39;m thankful for the tiny rainbow glitter that&#39;s formed by pixels of mist on my phone screen. i&#39;m thankful that even though i ran through a puddle, it was on the back end of my run and i have more than one pair of shoes and i can leave the others out to dry. i&#39;m thankful that i ran by the town donut store which is at the base of the graveyard and that it made me fantasize about getting donuts sometime during vacation. i&#39;m thankful that their jelly and cream filled donuts are well and truly filled, are so filled that i often feel sick afterward (but it&#39;s worth it). i&#39;m thankful to think that if ghosts have to haunt the graveyard after death, they would at least get to smell the warm yeasty exhaust of the donut store every day. i&#39;m thankful that the families of people visiting the graves of loved ones at the cemetery also get to smell the donut smell and maybe afterward visit the donut store to celebrate the sweetness of life, the children in their church clothes with red jelly smeared across their faces, their hands sticky.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the canned smoked oysters that my parents sent me for christmas. i&#39;m thankful that i had them with slices of sharp cheddar and one of d&#39;s mozzarella sticks and ritz crackers and a perfect pear for lunch. i&#39;m thankful that though i don&#39;t really like baked potatoes that much and so don&#39;t cook them very often, d was really in the mood for one and so i baked her a potato to have with our pork chops and roasted broccoli last night. i&#39;m thankful that i forgot to make the grated cauliflower that i was going to have instead of a baked potato and so d graciously agreed to split her potato with me, the same way she shared the massage. i&#39;m thankful for the fun of piercing the uncooked potato repeatedly with a fork, which was a job my mom gave me in the kitchen when i was a kid. i&#39;m thankful for the tip i read on serious eats about rubbing the outside of the potato with olive oil, which helps the skin crisp. i&#39;m thankful i cooked the potato perfectly, since in the past i&#39;ve often underdone the inside, which is unpleasant. i&#39;m thankful for the experience of splitting the hot potato and pressing pats of butter into it, for the unctuousness of the butter as it melted and spread through the fractured chunks of starch. i&#39;m thankful for the little bag of maldon salt that my parents sent me for christmas, which i sprinkled flakes of on top of the crispy brown skin and into the melty center of the potatoes.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to be an adult and get to choose what i eat every day. i&#39;m thankful to remember how my parents, meaning well, tried to force me to eat foods i didn&#39;t like when i was a kid, and how they often tried to force me to eat mashed potatoes, which were the food i then (and now, to a slightly lesser extent) find the most disgusting. i&#39;m thankful that my parents did not force me to eat mashed potatoes and foods i didn&#39;t like out of a reflexive parental authoritarianism but, i think, to encourage me to appreciate the food that we could afford and to respect the labor my mother had put into the meal and i think, more than anything in the specific case of mashed potatoes,  out of incredulity that anyone could dislike something as wonderful as mashed potatoes, which everyone in both my immediate and extended southern family loved like babies love mother&#39;s milk. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the sunday lunch at my grandparent&#39;s house, much retold in family lore, when my parents were trying to force me to eat mashed potatoes. i&#39;m thankful that i had a bad gag reflex as a kid, especially when confronted with foods i didn&#39;t like, so that as i tried to force the mashed potatoes down my throat, i started to gag and choke, the strangling sounds marring the quiet clatter of forks against plates and chewing and conversation. i&#39;m thankful that after i tried another bite, gagging more, that my grandfather, an incredibly kind and soft-spoken man who loved his grandchildren and golf and feeding birds, said, firmly and loudly and definitively, &quot;this is enough. if he does not want the mashed potatoes, he does not have to eat them.&quot; </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that this meal, more than 20 years ago now, was the last time i have had more than a spoonful of mashed potatoes (i&#39;m thankful that i have tried fancy haute thomas keller mashed potatoes as an adult, just in case you were wondering, in the hopes that they would make me like them and i could share that with my family, which i would love to do, but unfortunately, though i find them slightly less disgusting than my family&#39;s mashed potatoes, i still find them disgusting). i&#39;m thankful that if i don&#39;t want to, i may never have to eat mashed potatoes again (though i would do so to be polite if offered them at a dinner party, since as an adult my gag reflex is weaker and my will power is stronger). i&#39;m thankful for my grandfather, who i loved and who loved me and who i hope, if there is an afterlife, is resting in peace in a place filled with nice smells.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful for the nightmare in which my mother revealed to me, in a darkened upstairs bedroom, that i had had cancer for nine months and that she couldn&#39;t bear to tell me until now. i&#39;m thankful that in my nightmare, the cancer was, i think, drawn from my memory of how radiation sickness works in outer space in <i>seveneves</i>, of this image of invisible particles passing through the air and into the body and lodging there to destroy cells. i&#39;m struck by the weird sense of emotional scale in dreams, how this horror and despair seemed equivalent to the moment, earlier in the nightmare, when i &quot;realized&quot; that my christmas vacation was over and i had to get to work quickly. i&#39;m thankful for the one happy moment in the nightmare, when i was able to give a bunch of unripe bananas to a faculty member i work with so that her son (the one who in real life i gave the miniature frisbee) would have something to take to school for a class project. i&#39;m thankful that i briefly felt guilty for giving away our bananas without asking d, but then i talked to d and she said it was a nice thing to do. i&#39;m thankful i woke up and that i do not have cancer and my vacation is not close to over (though we don&#39;t have any bananas, except for one very soft brown one, because i forgot to buy them at the grocery store on saturday, and looking back this may have been the seed that generated the dream).<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that though i generally hate running on a treadmill, it was raining all day yesterday and so i was forced to try again to run on a treadmill. i&#39;m thankful that i used an old issue of <i>the new yorker</i> to cover the treadmill&#39;s display. i&#39;m thankful that i did this because, when the display is visible, i find that i constantly check the time and the imaginary distance that i have traveled and the (very) imaginary calories that i have burned and doing so causes time to feel as if it&#39;s moving incredibly slowly and i am unable to cover distances that, when running outside, seem like child&#39;s play. i&#39;m thankful that covering up the readout and watching something on my phone let the time fly by. i&#39;m thankful i watched the first forty minutes of <i>beautiful enemies</i>, the documentary about the buckley/vidal debates, on netflix. i&#39;m thankful for the snappiness of the editing and of the repartee. i&#39;m thankful for gore vidal&#39;s sick burns. i&#39;m thankful for how soaked my black t-shirt was with sweat when i was done.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that <a href=\"http://cheezburger.com/8275901184\">mark hamill looks just like zizek</a>. i&#39;m thankful to imagine the amazing sci-fi film essay that might eventually result from this coincidence. i&#39;m thankful for sophie fiennes, whose labor in making those great zizek films tends to be hidden by the volume of zizek&#39;s beard and voice.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that some mysterious thing happened and the seat belt in the passenger side of d&#39;s car has shifted such that the buckle, which for a long time was loose and would, when the belt was not in use, lodge in between the bottom of the seat and the door, necessitating that every time i enter the car and, by reflex, as one does, close the door, immediately open it again because with the door closed the buckle was out of reach, but now, something has happened and the buckle sits higher and is easily reachable with the door closed. i&#39;m thankful that i don&#39;t know what happened but that something definitely happened. i&#39;m thankful for mystery, especially when it provides solutions. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the keanu reeves &quot;<a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/woah-whoa-117P9MlBvxqSBi\">whoa&quot;</a> epiphany that moonlight is just sunlight reflected by the moon, which seems obvious but is not something i&#39;d ever thought about. i&#39;m thankful for the last epiphany i had like this, while killing time in a mall in southern california, where, beside a decorative pool surrounded by stone statues of dolphins, a plaque informed me that &quot;pacific ocean&quot; means &quot;peaceful ocean.&quot; i&#39;m thankful to be occasionally mystified by the obvious.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful that yesterday evening while i was getting ready to make a simple dinner of pasta and salad, d reminded me that today was trash and recycling day, which i had forgotten about in the loose time of a long vacation. i&#39;m thankful that since it had been raining all day for days and was still raining that d offered that we could drive over our recycling center downtown later in the week to get rid of our recycling rather than me have to deal with all of it in the rain. i&#39;m thankful for her thoughtfulness and thankful that i agreed, even though this (packing the recycling into her small car, transporting it, getting it out of the car into the industrial receptacles of the recycling center) seemed like it might be its own kind of ordeal. i&#39;m thankful, though, that when i took the trash down to the street (because it had to go out even if it was raining outside, because we had too much), i found that, contra to what it seemed when inside looking out into the dark wet world, it was really actually barely raining. i&#39;m thankful that it was 50 degrees out, the last gasp of the warm front that we&#39;ve been living inside for the past little while, and that by going out in the rain to take out the trash, which i did not want to do, i got to experience that kind of temperature outside for the last time for a long time, probably.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that, because of the warmth and the lightness of the rain, i decided to go ahead and take care of the recycling too, to save us the trip to the recycling center. i&#39;m thankful that d, who i called to from the mud room off the kitchen where i had stacked all the recycling, agreed to take over the making of dinner so that i could prepare, arrange, and transport the recycling. i&#39;m thankful that the large stack of cardboard boxes left over from christmas (i&#39;m thankful for all of their contents, and for the love each represents) broke and folded easily into flat planes that i could stack and insert into the recycling bins. i&#39;m thankful that d had collected the miscellaneous scraps of paper and tape and bubble wrap and et cetera into grocery bags, which made it easy to carry them to the bins; i&#39;m thankful for the satisfying sounds that beer bottles and crunched aluminum cans make when tossed into a container from a short distance. i&#39;m thankful for the fun one can find if one tries, even in a light rain, in trying to pack large quantities of disparate materials as efficiently as possible into small plastic containers (i&#39;m thankful that i can enjoy this because doing so because of the privilege of it not being something that i rely on for my livelihood). i&#39;m thankful that the ground was so waterlogged from days of rain that i decided not to take my normal trash day route through the yard on the left side of the house, but instead to go down the gentle slope of the asphalt driveway on the right side of the house. i&#39;m thankful that this meant i avoided getting stuck by the burs of the pest of a plant in the yard that i always run into unawares on trash day (i&#39;m thankful that by checking whether the correct spelling is &quot;bur&quot; or &quot;burr,&quot; i found out what kind of plant it is: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=burdock+burs&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1321&amp;bih=801&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc7OSepYHKAhWCgj4KHTuJC5UQ_AUIBigB\" style=\"z-index: 0;\">burdock</a>). i&#39;m thankful that taking the trash and recycling on my normal route through the yard on the left side of the house requires three trips (trash, recycling bin 1, recycling bin 2), whereas, with this new route, i realized i could pull the two recycling bins during the same trip like sleds down the asphalt driveway, thus saving myself an entire trip. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to find ways in both my personal and professional life to be more efficient, because there is a real satisfaction in achieving greater mastery of tasks (i felt such a childish burst of joy pulling the sleds down the asphalt driveway, slick and shining in the rain, the journey terminating like a kind of water slide in a bed of crunchy gravel at the border of the street), even as i worry, on the other hand, that making myself more efficient is just playing into the hands of an ideology that i find toxic, hands that close a little more around our throats every day. i&#39;m thankful, i guess, somewhat darkly ironically, that i have been told many times how the departmental office where i worked used to have two full time service staff and one part time support staff member, but, since i was promoted from the part time position to the full time position, they have not needed to hire a new part time support staff member because i&#39;m &quot;so good at my job.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the complex feelings i experience in relation to this comment, both the way i enjoy the praise for my abilities, which i work hard to hone, and yet am disturbed that my efficiency has removed a job opportunity from the world (one that i desperately needed when i applied for it and was so thankful to receive) and that i, as a worker, have not benefited from my efficiency, the fruits of which have instead been funneled back into the larger organization (i&#39;m thankful for the quiet compassion of my manager as she explained, when i tried to weaponize the fact that my efficiency had eliminated the need for a part time position in a perfunctory performance review, that she would love to give me a raise and thought i deserved one but had no ability to do so, thankful for how transparently and completely she unpacked the regulations and procedures that prevented her from doing so. i&#39;m thankful that with other managers this might have felt like lip service or excuses, but that it felt like a sad kind of honesty from my manager.). </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to think of the city sanitation workers who come to our street so early in the morning on tuesdays that, even though i get up early in the morning every day, i have to take the trash and recycling out on monday night to have it ready for them in time. i&#39;m thankful for my maternal grandfather, who is not a perfect person, and who worked first as a trucker (bringing the cardboard boxes and their contents to the buildings) and then as a city sanitation worker (picking up the cardboard boxes and their contents from the buildings) and who is now retired and living out on a small piece of land in the country. i&#39;m thankful that even though he is not a perfect person, and was not a great father to my mother the way that my mother is a great mother to me and my father is a great father to me, he was always kind to me when i was a child and i&#39;m thankful that he showed love in the ways that he was able, which mostly involved gifts (in cardboard boxes and palmed wads of money) rather than words. i&#39;m thankful to remember our most recent trip to my hometown in north carolina to visit him, when my brother and my father and i spent a genuinely pleasant time with him in his garage refuge swinging a ring hanging from a piece of fishing line tied to the ceiling across the garage to try to catch it on a hook attached to the wall several feet away. i&#39;m thankful for the way that we all shared strategies for better swings, for the right angle and speed, and i&#39;m thankful how we were proud for each other when we got the ring close to catching on the hook, whooping when it clanged against the hook. i&#39;m thankful that i can&#39;t remember whether any of us managed to accomplish the task and actually catch the ring on the hook, but i&#39;m thankful that that doesn&#39;t really matter to whether it&#39;s a good memory or a bad memory.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful that i got lost on my bike ride yesterday. i&#39;m thankful that my phone died unexpectedly as i tried a new route in order to avoid the muddy trails i usually take and i couldn&#39;t check a map, so i just had to make a guess and go in a direction and hope for the best. i&#39;m thankful that i biked for the first time through the tiny town of clear creek, which had a little concrete block post office and an antique store. i&#39;m thankful for the sensation of feeling instinctively that i knew which way i was going, of predicting and then gradually recognizing streets and landmarks. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m generally good at orienting myself in space, and thankful that i felt confident in my route for quite some time, but thankful that at a certain point i got turned around in an indistinct suburb and had no idea where i was. i&#39;m thankful that i had brought a coconut cream pie flavored protein bar in my backpack and that i stopped to eat it while figuring out where to go. i&#39;m thankful i finally came upon a road i knew the name of, but wasn&#39;t sure which way was north and which way was south (i needed to go north). i&#39;m thankful that i biked one way for a while and pushed up to the top of a hill and saw just trees and more road in the distance and decided that i was probably going the wrong way and that i should turn around. i&#39;m thankful for the hills here, even if they are punishing sometimes to try to climb, because of the beautiful (and, in this case, useful) vistas they frame. i&#39;m thankful that i made a decision and turned around and went back down the road the other way. i&#39;m thankful that though for a long time nothing looked familiar to me on the road and i wondered more and more whether i was going the wrong way, eventually, a sense of deja vu started to seep into my perception of the space around me and the space around me (the way the sidewalks were elevated above ditches, the apartment complexes), reminding me of a time years ago when i got pleasantly lost while running in the blue sky mirage heat of summer. i&#39;m thankful that continuing along the road got me to a place that i knew which got me on the road home. i&#39;m thankful for the experience of coasting down a hill and seeing a familiar place in the distance and knowing that&#39;s where i&#39;m going next.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the depth and breadth of the sadness i was stuck inside of  yesterday afternoon and evening after my bike ride. i&#39;m thankful that maybe the sadness was triggered by my fear of being lost on the bike ride and maybe it was triggered by our family dog having surgery to remove a melanoma from her head (i&#39;m thankful she&#39;s okay) and maybe it was triggered by too much red wine at lunch (i&#39;m thankful for how good it tasted, though) but that maybe it wasn&#39;t triggered by anything at all, no proximate cause, and there was nothing i could do to prevent it from enveloping me in its cloud. i&#39;m thankful to think of my brain as a weather radar map, the systems of emotions passing like glitchy primary-colored ghosts over my mental landscape along trajectories and with durations that can be guessed at but not known or controlled. i&#39;m thankful to think of the visual similarities between television weather radar  maps and the choppily animated fmri slices of the brain which are used to try to tell us things about how and why we think and feel. i&#39;m thankful, even though it wasn&#39;t fun to feel like the sadness was permeating every cell of my body, that it&#39;s probably better than other bad feelings i&#39;ve had in the past, like being afraid that i was going to die, or being afraid of interacting with the world around me, or being afraid of hypothetical things that might possibly happen in the feature, all which i used to feel all the time and rarely feel (or feel as intensely) now (i&#39;m so thankful for that). i&#39;m thankful for how the way that i sometimes feel sadness now makes me a little better able to understand the way that d feels sadness, which i always used to try to approach, because i love her and did not want her to suffer, as a concrete problem to be solved as quickly as possible by the application of a technology (concrete solutions, medication, conversation, exercise), like a support ticket i was trying to clear from the workflow of her mind. i&#39;m thankful that, though i didn&#39;t use to be able to understand why d &quot;chose&quot; to &quot;stay inside&quot; feelings of sadness (though i am thankful, always, to gently tease her about her adolescent love of emo music), i do understand it now, what it feels like, how it feels like there&#39;s only so much you can do to climb out (though i&#39;m thankful for the times when i can help her climb out). </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that even though i was feeling very sad yesterday afternoon, i buckled down and worked on a freelance project for a couple of hours in bed. i&#39;m thankful that rather than being a brat like i&#39;ve been about my writing in the past, i accepted and implemented my editor&#39;s revision instructions without any comment other than to wish him a happy new year. i&#39;m thankful, thinking of this, about how when i was sad in my early twenties, even though, objectively, there were plenty of things in my life worth being sad about, my sadness was almost always related to writing, how writing was going or how writing wasn&#39;t going. i&#39;m thankful to realize that writing now, whether in a professional context or in the context of these notes, doesn&#39;t really make me sad or afraid anymore, at least not in the same way or by the same order of magnitude. i&#39;m thankful for what a huge and wonderful change that is and how in retrospect it feels almost silly how serious i used to take the question of whether i would or wouldn&#39;t be able to write a blog post. i&#39;m thankful that the feelings of sadness i experienced yesterday allowed me to experience this epiphany as i wrote about it today.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to go through periods of sadness, most of all, because of the unbelievable sweetness of the relief i feel when they end, the way that later yesterday evening, while watching d navigate a labyrinthine dungeon in <i>a link between two worlds</i>, i took an easy breath and then another and suddenly realized that i didn&#39;t feel sad at all anymore, that i actually felt perfectly optimistic and okay and excited about the future. i&#39;m thankful that i slept well and woke up still feeling great, that i still feel great while i type these words. i&#39;m thankful that i don&#39;t suffer with sadness all the time like many people do and that i have many days when i don&#39;t feel sad at all. i&#39;m thankful for the yoga i did last night and the meditation i did after that, for how even if sadness can&#39;t necessarily be immediately and directly evaded or erased or resolved by targeted concrete solutions, it&#39;s still good to try things. i&#39;m thankful to think of that urban legend they used to tell us as a fact in DARE in elementary school about how if you took acid, traces of it would lodge in your joints and then, without warning, years later, you would bend your elbow or knee the wrong way and be stuck in a horrifying acid flashback. i&#39;m thankful for the way  that moving through poses and breathing loosens things in my body which usually makes my mind feel looser as well. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to have watched d play through the final dungeon in <i>a link between two worlds</i>, for the moment when we figured out that there were invisible bridges between platforms that could only be seen using a lamp in the dark. i&#39;m thankful for her intense effort to try to pass a particularly difficult obstacle, which involved using a wand that summon large blocks of ice to create stones in a bed of lava that she could walk along while avoiding being snatched up by a giant disembodied hand which floated above the level. i&#39;m thankful how she tried over and over and over to create the stones to walk across the lava, even though it was hard to aim the stones to make them land in the places she needed them to land; i&#39;m thankful for how close she would get sometimes before the stones would sink underneath her or the hand would snatch her up and return her to the bottom of the level. i&#39;m thankful that i could cheer on every little bit of progress, every new solution she found. i&#39;m thankful that, past our bedtime, she eventually gave up for the night and then, a few minutes later, i heard her giggling uncontrollably from the other room. i&#39;m thankful that she told me she had found the solution, which is that what we thought was a platform at the edge of the lava where she would begin to try to build her bridge of stones was actually, the whole time, a raft, and that there was no need to build a bridge, all she had to do was use the raft to ride across the lava to the goal. i&#39;m thankful that sometimes solutions are that simple.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\"><div>i&#39;m thankful for episode of the <a href=\"http://songexploder.net/wilco\">song exploder</a> podcast i listened to about wilco&#39;s song &quot;magnetized.&quot; i&#39;m thankful to learn about jeff tweedy&#39;s songwriting process, about how me makes what he calls &quot;mumble tracks&quot; where, over an instrumental snippet that seems like something, he mumbles through a melody and then listens to it over and over, looping a single bar, while he searches, like someone doing a jigsaw puzzle, to find words with syllables that match the rhythm. i&#39;m thankful for his belief that sense will always follow sound in this way, that inherently meaning will accrete and attach itself to the words somewhere in the process. i&#39;m thankful to think about my process in writing these notes, about the hope that this sturdy mechanical structure for starting sentences and the rambling strands that hang from it also get coated in the glitter of meaning sometimes. i&#39;m thankful for the song, which i hadn&#39;t listened to, for the abbey road tom fills and vocal ahs and oohs, for the use of noise gate as an expressive instrument rather than a studio tool, and for the warmth of the love that&#39;s expressed over the chorus chord turnaround when he sings, about what his love for his wife feels like, &quot;i sleep underneath / a picture that i keep of you next to me / i realize i&#39;m magnetized.&quot;</div><div><br></div>i&#39;m thankful that fifteen minutes before our friends were supposed to come over for dinner and drinks yesterday evening, as a i trimmed green beans in a kitchen, my temples felt like they were being squeezed by needle nose pliers. i&#39;m thankful that this is probably because i was hungry after spending the afternoon prepping for dinner and helping to get our house cleaner than it has ever been and forgot to eat a snack. i&#39;m thankful that i don&#39;t often get headaches, even if that meant this one felt extra bad in comparison to the baseline of how my head feels. i&#39;m thankful that i decided to have a whiskey and apple cider cocktail to see if that would make my head feel better; i&#39;m thankful that it was tasty, even though it didn&#39;t really make my head feel better. i&#39;m thankful for the sharp chef&#39;s knife i got for christmas, which made trimming the beans easier and faster than ever. i&#39;m thankful that i did not cut my fingertips with the knife, like i did the first time i used it, stupidly testing it&#39;s sharpness (i&#39;m thankful that d came in immediately and put bandaids around the tiny cuts on my fingers).<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful our friends came over for dinner. i&#39;m thankful for how much fun we have talking to them and hanging out with them. i&#39;m thankful for the pure sweet smile of their young child. i&#39;m thankful for the fun conversations we had with them, while sacked out on the carpeted floor of the study as their child crawled around to and fro between us, chasing balls and toys (i&#39;m thankful for the wooden toy they had made of small sticks knitted together in an abstract shape with wires, which made a satisfying xylophone sound when jangled). i&#39;m thankful that as we sat there chatting and playing, the nice conversation distracted me from the fact that rising behind my headache was a wave of horrible body conquering nausea. i&#39;m thankful that d could entertain them for a while i went to the kitchen to finish dinner prep, trying to pull myself together as i sauteed the green beans, cooked sausages, and made a quick pickled carrot. i&#39;m thankful that when i felt as though i was going to throw up and was hanging on to my composure by the tiniest thread, i called to d from across the house and she found me some dramamine in the depths of our medicine cabinet for me to take. i&#39;m thankful to remember after i got a wisdom tooth pulled a couple of years ago, when i was rocked by hydrocodone nausea so bad i couldn&#39;t move, and d came all the way home from work to give me dramamine and i felt better.</div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that i was able to pull myself together enough to finish cooking and sit sipping seltzer and trying to eat a banana for a few minutes while d and our friends had dinner. i&#39;m thankful that when eventually conversation amid the smells of food was too much, i escaped to the bathroom to hold my head between my hands and try to breathe and focus. i&#39;m thankful for how compassionate our friends were, how i could hear them, from across the house, inquiring about  my welfare and saying that we could always hang out another time if i wasn&#39;t feeling well. i&#39;m thankful that d came to check on me once and then a second time, and thankful that eventually i was able to splash water on my face and feel centered enough to hold it together. i&#39;m thankful that gradually i felt less sick over the rest of the evening until i didn&#39;t feel sick at all anymore. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t have to call our night early and that we were able to have more fun conversations about disparate topics including the fascinating process of lanolization, gossip about people from our mfa program, the ravages of depression and eating disorders, matcha, the ambient calm of baby einstein (i&#39;m thankful that their baby was entranced by our enormous television), our yoga practices, the difficulty of meditation, david mitchell and rebecca solnit, marina abramovic, stupid stuff we did in college, and xeno&#39;s paradoxes, among other things. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful that we had a good time with them and plan to have more in the near future and i&#39;m also thankful that, once we closed the front door behind them, d and i were able to shed the husks of our outward-facing selves and climb together into the warm couch blanket of introversion. i&#39;m thankful to think about how one of my fears about my relationship with d when it first started was that, because i was spending so much time with her, i had stopped reading <i>the new yorker</i> cover to cover every week. i&#39;m thankful for the retrospective silliness of how i thought this was a real serious thing to be worried about back then. i&#39;m thankful to recognize how stupid it is, when i&#39;m in a shitty mood or a bad place, or when i&#39;m struggling in vain to concentrate on reading or writing or doing some kind of task, to not value the gentle pressure of her hand touching my hip or her body pressing against me in bed or a warm kiss on the cheek or to hear her making small noises of laughter or delight or shock in response to something she&#39;s experiencing. i&#39;m thankful to enshrine that stupidity, to frame it in words here to help me remember that experiencing these little daily things is the most precious gift i can receive in the world and is always more important than whatever else i think i&#39;m supposed to be doing. i&#39;m thankful for the extreme version of this feeling i experience sometimes when we&#39;re having sex and i&#39;m coming, which is this dopamine epiphany of <i>why the fuck do i think anything else in the world matters besides this? how can writing a song or reading a book be better than this? why do i care about anything else outside of this feeling?</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>i&#39;m thankful, so thankful, for the way my love is crystallized in such moments, even if i&#39;m also thankful for the worth and the meaning that i can invest in the things of the world at other times. i&#39;m thankful that&#39;s true for d, too—i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://dire.tumblr.com/post/136275833656\">this comic</a> she made yesterday afternoon, which made me laugh harder than any &quot;shouts and murmurs.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that watching a youtube video yesterday, i realized that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhCNx7VEUG0\">old 90s ballad lyric</a> which i always thought was &quot;i&#39;ll be the greatest man of your life&quot; is actually &quot;i&#39;ll be the greatest <i>fan</i> of your life.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that i get to be the greatest fan of someone&#39;s life. i&#39;m thankful that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs\">magnets work</a>.</div></div>\n\n",

was catchy and fun but i wasn&#39;t really interested in the album i&#39;m thankful that she responded, incredulously, &quot;but what about &#39;me and the rhythm&#39;?!?! that album is great!&quot; i&#39;m thankful for &quot;me and the rhythm,&quot; which is excellent, and the album, which is, in fact, great (and so necessary given how lugubrious (if occasionally beautiful) <i>honeymoon</i> was) and which we danced to in the kitchen while making dinner last night. i&#39;m thankful for how lucky i feel that d&#39;s sister e is now my sister, and thankful for how much more fun our trip to southern california was because of her. i&#39;m thankful for how she played us the erykah badu cover of &quot;hotline bling&quot; which she liked better than the original and i knew what it was and she thought i was cool for knowing that (i&#39;m thankful that even if i know it, i like the mantra of the original better than the erykah badu cover, though i am also thankful for the beauty of the duet that was &quot;hello&quot;). i&#39;m thankful to remember our long family car trip to la and how we passed the time by playing would you rather. i&#39;m thankful to remember the question &quot;w<span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\">ould you rather get paid $5000 for cutting off your own finger or pay someone $5000 to keep the finger?&quot; and how e and d were surprised that i would cut off my own finger for $5000, so much so that while i was in the mcdonald&#39;s bathroom, they continued discussing it and then confronted me with the possibility once i came out that what if i had to cut it off slowly with a dull blade rather than </span><span class=\"lG\" style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\">a</span><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\"> single quick chop with </span><span class=\"lG\" style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\">a</span><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\"> butcher&#39;s knife, which convinced me to change my mind. </span></div></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:19.5px\">i&#39;m thankful for the trip we took to the library where we strip mined the graphic novel section. i&#39;m thankful for public libraries and thankful for the free shopping sprees that i&#39;ve gotten to take part at in them since i was a child. i&#39;m thankful for the graphic novels i&#39;ve read since: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451655903&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logicomix\"><i>logicomix</i></a>, an okay biography of bertrand russell;

than the average person and how it intertwines in my mind with a parable i recently heard in another film, related by the legendary drummer ginger baker about jack bruce&#39;s bass playing and his sense of time. i&#39;m thankful for his argument, whether it&#39;s true or not, that jack bruce is the kind of person who wakes up early and goes out to see the sunrise, sees the sun come halfway above the horizon, and then turns around and goes home satisfied to tell everyone that he&#39;s seen a sunrise. i&#39;m thankful for the ecstatic grainy archival footage of ginger playing drum solos in his heyday, his eyes closed to take in some kind of sunrise. <br><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the occasional chirp of a bird outside the house. i&#39;m thankful because these chirps remind me pleasantly of how annoyed i got at the constant noise floor of the cicadas in the summer and early autumn. i&#39;m thankful for the peace of the winter, even if that&#39;s a reflection of death and disappearance. i&#39;m thankful to look out the window and see a skin of frost on the grass in the yard. i&#39;m thankful that i finally went down into the basement to change our furnace filters, a task i have been putting off since the beginning of vacation. i&#39;m thankful that there were no wild animals down in the basement and that though i had to push through dense nets of cobwebs, i didn&#39;t get bit by any spiders. i&#39;m thankful changing the furnace filters was a simple process and i regret putting it off for so long and letting the task take up space in my brain. </div></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for the knausgaard <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-terrible-beauty-of-brain-surgery.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmagazine&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=magazine&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0\">article</a> about brain surgery. i&#39;m thankful for the structure and the returns and variations he plays, for his admission of his false nostalgia for life in the communist era (something i have a tendency towards also), for his cartographic descriptions of seeing the surface of the brain, and for his somewhat catty impressions of a famous surgeon&#39;s personality. i&#39;m thankful that the feeling lodged in my body after reading the piece reminds me more than anything of how i feel after reading a john mcphee profile, even though their working methods and subject positions and everything are so opposed. i&#39;m thankful for this passage:&quot;<i>i had looked into a room, unlike any other, and when i lifted my gaze, that room was inside hasanaj’s brain, who lay staring straight ahead under the drape in the larger room, filled with doctors and nurses and machines and equipment, and beyond that room there was an even larger room, warm and dusty and made of asphalt and concrete, beneath a chain of green mountains and a blue sky. all those rooms were gathered in my own brain, which looked exactly like hasanaj’s, a wet, gleaming, walnutlike lump, composed of 100 billion brain cells so tiny and so myriad they could only be compared to the stars of a galaxy. and yet what they formed was flesh, and the processes they harbored were simple and primitive, regulated by various chemical substances and powered by electricity. how could it contain these images of the world? how could thoughts arise within this hunk of flesh</i>?&quot; </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2015/12/30/10690560/time-speed-accelerate-age-new-year\">this vox explainer</a> about why the passage of time seems to accelerate as we get older. i&#39;m thankful for the various theories that are advanced in the article, including the idea that time seems to move faster for adults than for children because adults are busier than children. i&#39;m thankful for this illustrative quotation from william james: &quot;<i>each passing year converts some of this experience into automatic routine which we hardly notice at all, the days and weeks smooth themselves out in recollection, and the years grow hollow and collapse</i>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the hopeful note the end of the explainer strikes, that perhaps breaking routines and learning new things is one way to lay sandbags against the erosion of time. i&#39;m thankful to think that perhaps another weapon against acceleration is to find ways to focus more deeply on the present as you experience it, to use your attention as a brake to slow motion. i&#39;m thankful for the gentle click of the keys as i type this sentence, for the rumble of the furnace down in the basement pumping warm air up through the vents into the living room, for the occasional chirp of a bird outside the house.</div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful to consider the question of whether gratitude means an acceptance of the status quo, even if that status quo is unjust and evil. i&#39;m thankful to recognize that my personal investment in the concept of gratitude, as well as the privilege and security inherent in my subject position, might blind me from fully or appropriately considering the question, but thankful that considering the question feels like an important enough thing for me to continue along this line of inquiry here in these notes, however limited my personal perspective on it might be and however useless these words end up being. i&#39;m thankful if you would like to listen to me think but thankful also if you close this email now.<div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful to know and to recognize that we live in a society which is profoundly unjust for the people of color who live in it with me, even though knowing and recognizing that injustice doesn&#39;t seem to make any difference. <span style=\"line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful to know that the only real way to even begin to try to correct that injustice comes through systemic legislative and judicial reform. i&#39;m thankful that i know the necessity of this even though in the current political climate of my society, it seems impossible to conceive of achieving even a small fraction of the type of reforms that would even begin to try to answer to the enormity of the injustice, the genocide and theft and slavery and appropriation that are the central and foundational acts of the society that we live in and that continue to the present day.</span></div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thank to make clear that while i value gratitude and try to demonstrate that value to you daily as a way to try to help make our lives and, in a small way, the world better, i don&#39;t think we should ever feel gratitude for this kind of injustice, especially injustice as profound as the injustice of the society we live in. i&#39;m thankful that sometimes in these notes i send you i might use a sentence that begins &quot;i&#39;m thankful&quot; and then describes a quotidian unpleasant thing which i then try to view through the lens of gratitude as an exercise, but i&#39;m thankful to know that there are limits to this rhetorical device. i&#39;m thankful to know that there isn&#39;t (and shouldn&#39;t be) any way to be grateful for the murder or discrimination or abuse or theft or harm against people of color that is sanctioned by the state and accepted as the status quo by the society we live in. </div><div><br></div><div>i&#39;m thankful for <a href=\"http://lazenby.tumblr.com/post/125706997537/how-do-you-explain-the-new-kind-of-civil-rights\">this post</a> i was reading which talks about the foundational concept of gandhi&#39;s theory and its revelatory influence on martin luther king jr. when he heard it described one day while he was a student in seminary.</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;<i>On April 9th, 1950 Martin Luther King heard a black preacher named Mordecai Johnson (then the president of Howard University) speak in Philadelphia. Johnson had spent some time in India and spoke at length about the philosophical underpinnings of Gandhi’s method. </i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>To Gandhi, nonviolence was a matchless weapon. This is because it is founded on a concept called <b>satyagraha</b>. This word means something like ‘truth-force’ or ‘the persuasive power of love’ in Sanskrit. Nonviolent resistance could never be defeated because it was founded on love for one’s enemies. This love is the source of a protester’s refusal to physically attack his or her adversary. In Gandhi’s hands, and with the help of the international press, it had just been used to win the independence of 390 million people. <br></i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><div><i>King later said that this talk was so “electrifying that I left the meeting and went out and purchased half a dozen books on Gandhi’s life and works.” King was then still a student at Crozer Theological Seminary, just south of Philadelphia. That Sunday in 1950 was the beginning of nonviolent resistance in the American Civil Rights movement.</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>In reading about Gandhi’s philosophy and the strategy for Indian independence that it generated, Martin Luther King came to several realizations:</i></div></div><div><br></div><div><i>Nonviolent resistance refuses to participate in evil, but not in the same way that pacifism refuses. If pacifism simply refuses to participate in evil, nonviolent resistance is a passionate and relentless intervention in the lives of those who do participate in evil. In this way, King saw that the basic tension in any racial struggle was not between the races but instead within in the hearts of those who oppress. A tension between the basic desire of all human beings to be good and the racist conditioning by which life in America blunts this desire and bends their actions, instead, towards evil. King, like Gandhi before him, realized that nonviolent resistance was a way of untwisting the hearts of those who did this evil. Both saw nonviolent resistance as a kind of therapy that the oppressed performed on the oppressor</i>&quot; <br></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful to hear in the description of nonviolent resistance as &quot;<i>a kind of therapy that the oppressed performed on the oppressor</i>&quot; an echo of the exhaustion that i hear described frequently by people of color, this feeling that not only do they have to suffer every day from profound injustice and discrimination and violence and pervasive fear and alienation in the society that we live in, but then they also have to make white people like me feel better about it too. i&#39;m thankful that i can&#39;t even imagine how hard and frustrating that must be. i&#39;m thankful to recognize that for people to whom profound social and emotional and physical violence is done daily, as part of the basic, accepted routines of life, gratitude for the world must be exceedingly hard to come by. i&#39;m thankful to not expect people living impossibly hard lives to make themselves martyrs or saints, especially since in the society i live in there are enough white policemen murdering people of color and converting them into those holy images already.</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful that i admire this concept of </span>satyagraha that drove gandhi and king but i find that however attuned i try to force myself every day to be to gratitude and to kindness in my life, i can&#39;t imagine feeling it, much less imagine myself as a person of color feeling it, can&#39;t imagine the size of the reservoir of love energy that would be required to balance out the mass of the forces of oppression weighing down the bodies of people of color in the society we live in. i&#39;m thankful that, though i am not religious and though i think great evil is and has been and will continue be done in the name of religion, that throughout history and up to the present day, faith and belief have provided oppressed people who are subject to endless violence and fear with some measure of comfort and strength.</div><div><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful that this is why i write the things i do these days, in the hope that it will provide people with some measure of comfort and strength. i&#39;m thankful, in that spirit, to try to conceive of gratitude as a kind of tactic, in the sense of the situationists, who believed, amid the violence of 68, in the power of &quot;<i>creating &#39;</i></span><i>situations&#39; where humans would interact together as people, not mediated by commodities. They saw in moments of true community the possibility of a future, joyful and un-alienated society. &#39;</i><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><i>People who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints, such people have corpses in their mouths.&#39;&quot;</i></span><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"> i&#39;m thankful to suggest attention to and gratitude for small things you value in the world as a tactic in this sense, not</span><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"> because the society we live in is just and fair and perfect, but because so much in the world is horrible and wrong and you have to save yourself from it, every day, by reminding yourself why you want to live, what you are living for.</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><br></span></div><div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XykIswFgLpU\"><span style=\"line-height:1.5\">i&#39;m thankful for the thudding kick drum and for its dance with the clap and the chimes and the streamers of out of time (and yet in time) guitar flickering at the edges of the image. i&#39;m thankful for the way that the cymbal chokes a breath at the end of bars. i&#39;m thankful for the sense of space in the samples, a place to live inside. i&#39;m thankful for the space echo on her vocals, so that her voice makes a woozy choir of itself behind her, like the train on a ball gown. i&#39;m thankful for when she sings &quot;<i>w</i></span><i>e been livin&#39; through your internet</i>&quot; and suddenly her voice disappears the music falls out, the space collapsing, and there&#39;s the sound of a gong chiming in front of you and then she&#39;s back in the world, singing &quot;<i>you don&#39;t have to believe everything you think / w</i><span style=\"line-height:1.5\"><i>e&#39;ve been programmed wake up, we miss you</i>.&quot;</span></a></div><div><div><br></div></div></div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>\n<div>i&#39;m thankful, after writing <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-4-20\">one of my favorite letters on this day last year</a> about sobriety, to have rediscovered how much i love weed. i&#39;m thankful to not write about this very much to protect my present and future employability (this letter is email only and won&#39;t live on the web in my archives). i&#39;m thankful that part of me feels sad to break the impression set in that letter from a year ago, since i like the person depicted there and the way he found a place in the world, but i&#39;m thankful also for the opportunity to be real with you. i&#39;m thankful that i am a complex person and that i change over time and i&#39;m not ashamed of that.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful to have rediscovered how much i love weed when d and i were in chicago last december and after dinner one cold and rainy night we went to a grotty sex shop i found on yelp to buy a cheap vibrator (we forgot to pack one). i&#39;m thankful that while we were checking out, which (i had never bought a vibrator from a sex shop) involved this strange and elaborate process of the clerk putting on rubber gloves, taking the vibe out of the box and putting batteries in it, showing us that it worked, and then reversing the process to repackage it, i saw a display of cheap glass pipes in a display case and bought one on a whim.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful that night that we tried the pipe instead of our expensive USB-powered vaporizer and i got high in a way that i hadn&#39;t in a long time, without the jitters and unpleasantness that had accompanied my occasional vape highs of the previous year, which i had blamed on the prozac. i&#39;m thankful to have rediscovered the power of combustion and i&#39;m thankful that after a while with the pipe, we upgraded to a bong, which was even better. i&#39;m thankful for the experience of pulling the slide and the magic of physics pushing all of the smoke in the chamber at high speed into my lungs.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful to miss some of the purity of sobriety, but i&#39;m thankful for weed, which is kind of like a vibrator for the soul.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful i don&#39;t get high as frequently as i did in the past, that it doesn&#39;t have to be a daily ritual like it used to be, but i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s there when i need it. i&#39;m thankful to get high before all my band practices, which loosens my inhibitions and enhances my giggliness and my ability to feel a groove. i&#39;m thankful after a particularly stressful day at work to have a way to erase my exhaustion. i&#39;m thankful that when we went to knoxville in february, i had a bottle of weed tincture and was basically constantly very high, which is a lovely way to experience a vacation.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful weed has made it easier for me to (almost, 99.9% of the time) quit drinking, which has really been good for my stomach. i&#39;m thankful to know that this is such a tired and obvious point of view (i&#39;m thankful that in the united states we are always tired and obvious, which lends itself to this), but to feel that it really is horrible that weed is illegal but alcohol isn&#39;t. i&#39;m thankful to know that weed isn&#39;t for everyone, but i&#39;m thankful that it doesn&#39;t exacerbate any of my mental or physical illnesses and am thankful that for me it isn&#39;t a gateway drug that leads to addiction to more dangerous drugs.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful for weed, which unlike alcohol never hurts my stomach (unless i eat too much sugar, which is the one negative side effect) and unlike alcohol doesn&#39;t give me hangovers and unlike alcohol sometimes makes me feel a kind of spiritual grace. i&#39;m thankful for all the ideas that i have when i&#39;m stoned and i&#39;m thankful that though a lot of them are stupid, a lot of the ideas i have when i&#39;m sober are stupid too and there is a simple pleasure in just having a lot of ideas no matter their quality or whether they can be packaged into a product to be bought and sold. i&#39;m thankful that my brain on drugs isn&#39;t a frying pan with an egg in it but a field where a mysterious variety of flowers sprout in a sped-up timelapse springtime.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful that tonight after work d and i will get high and eat strawberry shortcake and watch some TV and listen to some music on speakers and talk and touch each other (i&#39;m thankful for the way weed heightens sensations like touch and brings down the barriers we sometimes wear through our everyday lives) and have ideas and write and draw and play guitar and laugh and smile and then probably fall asleep earlier than usual but also happier than usual. i&#39;m thankful to know that we could and do experience all of those things with weed, but i&#39;m also thankful for weed.</div>\n</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful that the past few days i have been living some really angsty vibes about not being the official best friend of the person i thought of as my official best friend, even though i have known that our definitions of best friendship varied for a long time and am also not thankful for that because it has not been fun and also objectively we are very good friends who have shared many happy times and intellectually i know it is fucked up and unfair of me to not just be able to appreciate that and be happy with what it is and but for viscerally my body just has not wanted to accept it for some submerged trauma kind of reasons i think and so lately always around the edges of some very good days at work, in the flow of writing code for problems that are hard enough that they&#39;re challenges to solve and provide opportunities for choices of style and creativity and express and occasional provide a need to collaborate with others but not so hard that i constantly have to emerge from the woodshed to ask for help to progress, that i instead get to spend alone with form and abstraction building a thing outside of me that performs, but then also the design system engineer saying that i&#39;d done well with something he&#39;d started me on, and i&#39;m thankful to recognize how dumb this feeling was, that around the edges of that and the beginning of summertime, my favorite season, while running long distances outdoors in short sleeves, i have been feeling in my nerve endings a deep ambient sadness (and a meta sadness at the stupidness of being consumed by this sadness that i think is unfair and i don&#39;t want to feel) about this friendship, about not having a best friend, never really having had one, and gone long stretches of time with no friends at all, and after dinner i talked about this with d, who is my best friend, and she had very thoughtful things to say and reminded me of a concept we learned about in couples therapy, which is the idea of a &quot;bid&quot;, as in you making a gesture of connection and how when someone in a relationship makes a bid and the other person chooses to accept the bid and respond, that kind of interaction is a positive feedback loop for building or for repairing a relationship, and how her therapist had told her that it&#39;s always better to talk to someone if you can (which sometimes you can&#39;t there are people who might respond to this who i just don&#39;t have the capacity to talk with, which yes is its own weird dimenstion of this document) and anyway i felt better having talked to d about this and while i ate the mi goreng noodles mixed with sauteed shredded brussels sprouts that had grown cold over the course of the conversation and i reheated in the microwave (a story i always love about d is that in the past she would sometimes eat so slowly she would have to heat up a dish again, which is something that she shared with her dad and is so interesting to me as a vacuum cleaner of food), we watched this week&#39;s episode of <i>the kardashians</i>, which i think is an all-time great episode, so postmodern and self-reflexive, and i smoked some weed named after a super hero and felt better and checking my notifications saw that i had a snapchat from one of my best friends at work, who sometimes sends me silly little improv characters she does, and she was out to drinks with three other people that are some of my best friends with at work who were in town to prototype, and it began with a, the first designer whose designs i built with code, saying &quot;hi justin remember you were my best friend first&quot; and then the camera pans to k.d., the designer i work with now, and she says &quot;justin is definitely my best friend&quot; and then the camera pans to j, who is the first product manager i worked for, who lifts her wine glass and says &quot;justin you know i was your best friend first&quot; and then the person recording the video, k.a., hits the button that flips it to the selfie cam and winks and is like &quot;justin, you know what&#39;s up, we&#39;re best friends&quot; or something like that, i may not have the words right because i could only watch the snap chat and then hold the button to replay it one more time, but i&#39;m thankful for the ability to write it down and encode the memory, this silly little moment of all my best friends just telling me they&#39;re thinking of me, and sometimes life really really sucks but sometimes life gives you some shit like that and god i am thankful.</div>\n\n",

    "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">i&#39;m thankful, since i think i failed some conversational tests and/or my sociocultural profile seems to have disqualified from me ever getting prescribed benzos by an actual doctor (remember when [redacted] had the same doctor as me and was prescribed them and i wasn&#39;t), for the valium i bought from the pharmacy across the street from our hotel on our last day in cancun. i&#39;m thankful for how easy it was to stand in the middle of racks of sunscreen and look at a laminated printout probably from microsoft word with rows of names and dosages and quantities of all the fun things and how my only regret was getting distracted by the idea of valium (since i had had xanax but never valium and there&#39;s something alluring about the word and the idea of it, [redacted], who i bonded with over love of these drugs, had really romanticized it) and ending up buying a much lower effective dosage of that than i could have if i had bought xanax. i&#39;m thankful that since my relationship with xanax in the past had been always one of scarcity and fear and thus to hoard them in case of extreme emergency, i told myself i would use the mexico valium actively to improve my life in the present as a mechanism against the sunday scaries&mdash;if ever on a sunday i felt even a little bummed out, i gave myself carte blanche to take one (they were these little pink circular tablets). i&#39;m thankful that i did it routinely the first few weeks and then one week midweek i was just like &quot;oh wait i didn&#39;t even take it&quot; and i did a few more times but mostly don&#39;t even think about the possibilty, which feels like really nice. i remember vividly when i was first on prozac walking to work one morning, a walk that was always full of anxiety for the day ahead, and just realizing that i was just enjoying the walk and i wasn&#39;t really thrumming with anticipation of entering the social space of work and times like that one are why i love drugs (and drug-like experiences), because they give me access to other ways of being and feeling than the default way, which in my case has always been so fraught and bad.\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>i&#39;m thankful d and i, after a long smooth flat stretch, hit a small bump in the road, and i&#39;m thankful we were eventually able to talk through it and i&#39;m thankful i took a valium when we were still in it and i didn&#39;t know how long it would stretch into the future and i couldn&#39;t feel like that anymore and then we got out of it and the panic valium became celebratory and made a cocktail with mezcal and mango kombucha and leftover macerated strawberry syrup and did a few bong hits and ate a strawberry mango paleta d made and then some of a honey mama carrot cake truffle while we watched love island, where there was this scene of two characters who seemed to have a really good relationship which was then threatened when another man, who had recently broken with his first partner on the show, tried to spark something with her and she seemed torn but then there was this night vision footage of her and the first guy sitting on the steps of the villa together and him being vulnerable about how he thought that her sleeping in the bed with another guy (a requirement of the show&#39;s &quot;recoupling&quot; wouldn&#39;t bother him (and how much he cares about her) and you can see in real time this shift on her face where it&#39;s clear she&#39;s in love with him and then he seems to to recognize that in her and she climbs down several stairs to come closer and they embrace and it&#39;s just very beautiful.</div>\n</div>",
